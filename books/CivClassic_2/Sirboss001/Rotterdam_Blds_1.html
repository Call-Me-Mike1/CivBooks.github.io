<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Rotterdam, the Capitol and primary city of Columbia, is in many ways an exception.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The many facades of Rotterdam are like a time capsule of Columbian history: you can see the country opening up in the grandeur of the main</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">train terminus, commercial adventurism in the economic district, imperialistic goals in the Archway, and the Columbian Renaissance in the stately mansions on Imperial Avenue.

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">years, and this book will attempt to explore not only the varying architectural styles and motives throughout the city, but also the psychological mindset behind them. Let us begin....</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>=================== A reasonable start to any architectural examination of Rotterdam, the BOX Theatre is the anchor point from which the modern city has grown. A stone mountain whose size is further exaggerated by the</div></div>

That last point though has been occasionally controversial throughout</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Columbia's history, as the BOX Theatre is a jagged, rocky, new mountain. Built out of essentially one material, smoothstone brick, it is a cross between an Austrian Operahouse and Dracula's Castle. Like the early Columbia it was built in, it is a flurry</div></div>

Still, with chaos come character, and who can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">truly admonish a build that was created collectively, as a birthday present to another citizen, with great optimism for the Columbia to come. Who can talk badly about a building with such heart, such history.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================I find it remarkable that despite the fact that I have lived in Columbia nearly two years, despite all monuments and great works I have completed, that I can still be amazed at the beauty of our</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Town Hall. Just to the North of the Plaza of the Republic and adjacent to the BOX Theatre, this is another structure that hails from the early days of Columbia, and in my mind represents a time when Columbia began setting a course for success. I find it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to be a wonderful build, both simple and complex in the right places. Just over three stories with a sloped roof and central flag tower, from the rooftops it has the appearance of a University building or a Schoolhouse, or maybe even a Town Hall, which in</div></div>

It represents what it is to a T, with its modest two wings attached to a central atrium, correclty wide and correctly long, and always bright on the outside due to the sea lamps. The building has seen recent completion this past year</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================What if a building served as an identity? What if you were to spend months on a building, a single structure, and not some vault hole or mindless cavern, but a legitimate and functional building. What would</div></div>

The answer for one such player can be seen in Knot Tower, by KnotNSA, a cultural fact of the city that is rich in it's art deco design. Like many minecraft skyscrapers, its beauty comes in the repetition of its facade, and this can be seen</div></div>

The exterior is reminiscent of the best parts of New York City at the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The true victory of the tower over Rotterdam comes infact from its insides however, which have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">seen numerous rennovations through the course of Columbian history, and as a result offer an enjoyable experience. Still, when you turn away from the robust detailing of the interior, you can sometimes still see dark corners that have remained unfinished</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and forgotten for years.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================A simple building that does nothing more than fit in with its surroundings, it was built competently but without any spirit or motivation, no confidence. The insides however have experienced a relatively</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================If you peaked between some of the more elegant structures lining Imperial Boulevard, standing proudly behind some of them would be the Grand Hotel Rotterdam. A fun structure that not only</div></div>

Its lobby features one of two of Rotterdam's indoor pools, and its rooms exude luxury despite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">being relatively compact. The building is wider than it is longer, which is a benefit, as a glance to its sides can sometimes be dissapointing as they are mostly lack of any solid detail.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================What if you were tasked with creating your country's premier international arrivals terminal in what amounted to a one-chunk 70 block deep hole? The author had to face this problem</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in constructing Rotterdam Station, which today is a mixed victory, like much of Columbian history. It was built during a period of wavering Columbian prosperity, and as a result its features are sometimes explosive and sometimes bland. Its scale is its</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================The first monument of infrastructure in Rotterdam, but certainly not the last, this suspension bridge connects two highland farm villages, and for a long time towered over the northern areas</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of the city. Its relevancy has waxed and waned like its namesake, and it sometimes sees heavy use, or none at all. Still, proof that measured simplicity in infrastructure can be eye-pleasing, this bridge is as solid as its foundations.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>===================Royalism may be controversial, but this building is not. A wonderful addition to the East side of town, The Kdeeks Mansion has beautiful gardens, an elegant Second-Empire roof,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">wonderful interiors, and is simultaneously not too small and not too large.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>==================="In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to</div></div>

But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.
