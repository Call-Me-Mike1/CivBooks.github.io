<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Another day or so later, I returned and created a small stall in hopes to acquire some easy cash from bookworms. It worked.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>I lounged around the Olympic village the day of the Olympics --hoping to catch some athletes fucking like hounds in the nation houses. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Before it began, the slave-master Aki thanked his drugged up builders for their work. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Mount Augustan parade left something to be desired, it was one sad, sad person walking through an empty stadium. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>An invisible man, a pest of Yoahtl, ran onto the field and punched Aki. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Remain focused" I told myself as the archers took their places in the stadium. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I quickly ran to the bathroom before the event, banging the "Anti-Yoahtl" banner that was perched atop my head as I ran up and down the stairs. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The archery didn't seem very hard, they were very big</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Feathercrown ran sporadically around the stadium as LLE2 and gabeladela1 --the Rowans-- took their place.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was at this time that Aki seemingly ran away from the stadium. Feather looked desperately</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>During this time, gabel was also nowhere to be found, I suspect some sort of love affair with Aki, so I snuck up to the Olympic Flame.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The flame is nothing but a sham, there was no real fire, just smoke and lights.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I then took a seat in the fancy section of the stands as Aki returned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
