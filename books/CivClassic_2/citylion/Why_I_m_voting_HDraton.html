<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 11</a><div class="page-content">To the citizens of Mount Augusta, 2018 November 25th,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I am urging all of you to deeply consider electing HenryDraton as your mayor in the upcoming election. HenryDraton is the most dedicated player I have ever met in Mount Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The first time I interacted with HenryDraton he was working on his Megafarms project in Mount Augusta. I stopped by and was surprised by the giant fields he was botting. I hadn't know much about botting up to this point. But I was amazed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Eventually seeing Henry's dedication to making exp in Mount Augusta led me to start my own exp infrastructure projects in Albion. I aspiried to make Albion into an exp powerhouse. I led an initiative in Albion to make "superfarms", a large beet with with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">clay blocks under it, a vine farm, a netherwart farm, and a sugercane farm. I wanted to see our local area as an exp production powerhouse because of Henry. We began collaborating on farming, and made a small local group called AAHI for our exp efforts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Henry led the majority of and spearheaded the production efforts. He ultimately gave almost two runs away to citizens in the city. Another small portion was later given to me to make tools and armor for players in our city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Another one of the first interactions I had with Henry was diamond mining with him. He was really interested in making diamond factories for the city. In one night Henry and I mined and mined, and each time we accumulated enough diamonds for a new diamond</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">factory, we met up with Program in the old MAFO bunker, and created it with him. We made posts on the subreddit for each factory, which I found quite amusing. We mined for hours, but we managed to build every single diamond tool factory, and in the coming</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">days we made the diamond armor factories. I was later saddened by the fact that these factories somehow went missing - were likely destroyed by a raider or rogue citizen. I'm still astounded to this day by how much fun we had making those factories.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Around that time May Day was coming up too. I remember that Henry and Romec were grinding and grinding in the hours leading up to it, in order to make enchanted pickaxes to give away for the city. Henry wanted to see players in the city with better tools.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Much later than the aforementioned interactions, I remember HenryDraton was in the mumble repairing a rail junction, if I remember correctly, this one was to the Spruce Farm. At the time he was managing the station, working  with Blockbuster's rails,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">ensuring all of them worked, and once in awhile adding new rail connections, when necessary. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>These are a few of the interactions I've had with HenryDraton. He has always worked hard to better Mount Augusta. This, is why I am voting for HDraton.</div></div>
