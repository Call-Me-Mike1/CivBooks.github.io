She looked around the bedroom and only saw darkened, but familiar, features. She let the swaying of the ship calm her and returned to sleep soon.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   The next morning, she awoke to find that there was</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   Ms. Grace Altali felt a chill down her spine. Had the captain let himself into her cabin at night? why did he do</div></div>

She dressed and went up to the open deck and looked over the waves. They calmed her again, always had they done so.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   When Grace was a child, she had often gone out, against her parents' wishes, and sat just</div></div>

She would set things in them and wait a long time for the sea to return them to her or keep them for itself. She would find great fun in this and had since then watched the waves most of when she could.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

Grace took in air and went to get a few of her own sketch-ware. She returned the the bow of the upper-deck and took a seat on a steady crate.
