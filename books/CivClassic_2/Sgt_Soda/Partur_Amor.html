She had just stepped out onto the deck of the ship, the XC Partur, after a restless night thinking. Thinking about what she was doing. Thinking about where she was going and</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I would like to beg your pardon for being so rude when you initially boarded the Partur. Might you join me for dinner in my quarters this evening? Richard has informed me that there is a storm not far off</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   She sat across from him, both at his desk, and watched him do this.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   Dinner was, for once, heard before smelled, as the wind carried the smell away on deck for the short time it was there. When it was on the now cleared desk, though,</div></div>
