<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
In the Fire Kingdom, lived the young knight.
The knight was beloved by those in the Fire Kingdom, for no man was more dedicated, nor passionate, nor more caring than he.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
The Knight of Fire rose each morning like the burning sun at dusk, eager to continue his quest to serve the people of the Fire Kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
Each day the Knight would work himself tirelessly, swinging his axe wildly at the trees of the enchanted forest to build his physique, so he would always be stronger than his opponent in battle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
When a thief stole the Knight's beautiful obsidian-encrusted dagger, the people of the Fire Kingdom readied for bloodshed. But the Knight was caring, and gave the thief the blade to sell so he might care for himself and his family.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
When the Fire King ordered that the Knight gather ore, the Knight quickly crafted his pickaxe and set off for the caves. Eager to impress, the Knight dug and dug and dug without sparing a moment, even to take in the beautiful view.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
One day, the Knight woke up to a shrieking sound. He jumped out of his bed and looked out of the window and to his horror...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------the Water Kingdom was attacking. Citizens sprinted down streets, running from the diamond swords of the Water Kingdom soldiers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
The Knight burst in to action without hesitation, grabbing his axe and rushing into the courtyard.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
The Knight looked around at the ground, soaked in the blood of his compatriots, their stone swords laying at their feet. If only, the Knight wished, he had paid greater attention to detail when mining Perhaps then his Kingdom would not be outmatched.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
As the knight reached the center of the city square, he screamed in horror. Lying dead, uncerminously in the street, was the Fire King. Pertruding from his chest was the Knight's Obsidian dagger. Standing over the king was the thief, dressed in all blue.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
Eventually, the thief and his fellow Water Kingdom raiders encircled the knight. As they each rushed in, dealing blows, the knight swung his axe wildly from side to side; each strike carrying great power behind it, but missing the enemy entirely.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
The soldiers of the Water Kingdom take turns piercing the knight with their sword and tridents. The knight screams in pain, and thinks to himself; perhaps if I had focused on technique rather than passion and strength, I would live through this day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"THE KNIGHT OF FIRE"
-------------------
But he didn't, and he did not.</div></div>
