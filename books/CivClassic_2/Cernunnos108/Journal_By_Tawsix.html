<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Got the farm working and had enough reeds left over for this shitty book. Wheat actually grows when the server isn't lagging to shit, which is nice.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

I'm debating whether or not to try to take some of this shit to Columbia to sell. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I feel pretty isolated enough to not have to worry too much about faggots fucking with my shit. I may need to expand the back yard some more, and maybe add a lava moat around it to keep the fucking spiders away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/25 9:14pm. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I fell out of a fucking tree.  I got on top of the house, jumped on a tree, and tried to jump to another tree. I didn't make it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now I'm eating Corn Pops, and they are fucking delicious.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Still eating Corn Pops.  Going to go walk around outside, probably going to get killed . Of course, no sooner do I walk out of the fucking door I get mobbed by a zombie and a spider, who fuck my shit up.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then a skeleton comes and finishes me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">off....fuck<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>About half way to Columbia now.  Made a pit stop in some guy named masters346892369 o r something.  Apparently he had died.  Walking through jungle terrain sucks dick.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Thankfully, it appears someone carved a tunnel through a fucking mountain to get around this shit, hopefully it actually comes out the other side and I don't die in here like a tool.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/26 4:08am <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Found a structure in the shape of a giant "F" with a shitty attempt at a wheat farm and some random crap in a chest at the top of the F.  Left a dirt tower next to it to make the guy think he got mugged and wonder what the fuck I took.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Standing around until his wheat grows, because I'm a fantastic person. ::Found a nice house in between a jungle and a desert.  Pretty much empty inside. Found a sign in the basement saying "rdhayes was here".  Prick probably looted the shit out of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/26 4:20am <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Made it to the boarder of Columbia.  First thing I did in Columbia is fall down a fucking sink hole and I couldn't keep minecraft from crashing long enough to swim out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 31</a><div class="page-content">They've got a bookshelf so you can read shit I guess.  Going to check it out, then carry on. ::Just a bunch of coordinates.  What a fucking worthless read.   Would not recommend.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/26 5:07am <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Well Columbia was a fucking dump.  Kind of dissapointed. Found a nether portal going back to my house about 2 minutes north of Columbian border. Dare I?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Well I dared, and it was fucking retarded and now I'm way the fuck up in the air on some tree in a jungle somewhere, probably a million fucking miles away. Great. ::Ran into an NPC village.  <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Looks like it got creepered pretty badly at some point.  Or TNT'd.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/49 12:40 <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I had to go home this weekend.  Logged on with my shitty laptop to see if anyone had fucked with my shit.  Sure enough, some dick lit my house on fire, stole some of my iron, and did a terrible job replanting my farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I was able to save the house and patched the holes with dirt until I get around to actually fixing it up.  No diamonds for a snitch block, so I can't find the faggot that did it and kill him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Upon further inspection, they dug out around the corners of my tree farm, apparently looking for my hidden stash.  What a bunch of fucking failures.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/29 3:12pm <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I log on and some douche left the front door and gate open.  I go about my business, tending my wheat and shit, when all of a sudden I hear the trap door to the lower mines open, and some twat named quackaduck pops out and stares at me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 31</a><div class="page-content">We exchanged "pleasantries" and he left.  He says he didn't take anything, but I'm pretty sure he did.  He also made a fucking huge hole in the wall down in the mines, it goes on for fucking ever with absolutely nothing to mine in it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I am seriously wondering if everyone on this server was raised by fucking wolves or something. Manners are more rare than diamonds around here. ::And at this point, the server is laggins so fucking badly the wheat is taking ages to fucking grow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Pissing me off.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 31</a><div class="page-content">4/30 8:29pm <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So some cockbag burned down my house, broke all my chests, and killed me.  Also tore up all my wheat. Made a god damn mess of the place.  Luckily they didn't find my fucking stash.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Fucking faggots. Just finished getting everything back in order.  Will be more vigilant in putting important things in the stash more often, lost some iron ore.  Just about everything else was recovered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I really need to find some diamonds already so I can build a fucking snitch box and start adding fuckers to my kill list. ::On a side note, I'm glad I got my fucking journal back, need to start making copies, probably won't be so lucky in the future.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 31</a><div class="page-content">5/2 11:52pm <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I finished the first layer of my mega wheat farm, too bad wheat is basically worthless. I'm heading over to Central City now. I have a ton of books for the library over there, hopefully it helps them out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I'll probably come back to find my house burned down again, I can't wait.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 31</a><div class="page-content">5/4 4:43pm <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Logged on, found a sign where my dog was telling me some faggot killed it.  Also stole a bunch of watermellons. You be the judge.</div></div>
