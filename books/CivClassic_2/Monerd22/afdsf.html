<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Spawned about 1000 blocks away from the Nexus, and made my way there. At this point I didn't understand the rail system very well and didn't have the resources to make a cart, so I ran down the north east</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now, this passage is not marked on the map. So, I ran to near the coordinates of Charcoal town, found my way up, and started my real journey.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Around Charcoal town I found some food and supplies to make a</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Heading back to the Nexus, I wasn't sure where to head next, my head was filled with wishes of exploring and discovery. I decided I would first visit Taozi in Gensokyo as I read somewhere that it was a very populated area most of the time.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It wasn't. As beautiful and magnificent as Taozi is, there was not a soul in sight, even though I must have triggered hundreds of snitches.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Reading some more, I learned Adina was a populated area, so naturally I joined their Discord to ask about the area.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">A user from the Adnia Discord contacted me asking if I would like to visit Nro'meagh, as I had said I was a newfriend in the Discord.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This led to my journey about 10,000 blocks south to Nro'meagh, specifically the city of Jevoghnya. This town was full of </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">ancient Egyptian architecture and has an awesome feel to it. A citizen (possibly the owner) of the city named "Monerd22" toured me around this vast mountainous area and to the surrounding cities. 
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I said my farewells to Monerd22 and headed Norht towards</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">the city of Vinland, to catch a rail to Adina!
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I stopped part way before Adina City and ran to check out Terestai, it is another beautiful town, but I was anxious to see the city of Adina and whether it was just as amazing as they described it.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">When I arrived I realized the city is quite nothing like it is on the map. They have a huge town hall area, a magnificent rail station and many beautiful colors and buildings surrounding, suprising me as to how this could all be built so quickly. It was</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But, I had exploring to do. </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I saild east on the ocean towards a marking on the map which is only known as "Cape Farms". Weird.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Which is exactly the reason is peaked my interests.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Arriving to Cape Farms, it was a small bordered</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now, this is where the story become slightly frightening for me being such a noob</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I headed east of Cape Farms to wards an unknown build, which to me looked like an obvious tree farm, but it was oh so much more than that. I made my way to the near island, climbed up it and saw the tree farm. More east was a massive cactus farm</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">and even more east was a dome covered pigman farm (i think?) underground with 6 or 7 massive nether portals. 
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Anyways, I then set off towards Entrana, as that has to be the dopest name on this server yet.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Unfortunately, it seems the town is now dead</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">and it took me a very long time to find the water drop to their rails to log off for the night.</div></div>
