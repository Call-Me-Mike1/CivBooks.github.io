         1910. By Voltairine De Cleyre

It is not to be supposed that anyone will attain to the full realization of what he purposes, even when those purposes do not involve united action with others; he will fall short; he will in some measure be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">overcome by contending or inert opposition. But something he will attain if he continues to aim high. 

What, then, would I have? you ask. I would have men invest themselves with the dignity of an aim higher than the chase</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">for wealth; choose a thing to do in life outside of the making of things, and keep it in mind - not for a day, nor a year, but for a lifetime. And then keep faith with themselves! Not be a light-o'-love, today professing this and tomorrow that, and easily reading oneself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">out of both whenever it becomes convenient; not advocating a thing today, and tomorrow kissing its enemies' sleeve, with that weak, coward cry in the mouth, "Circumstances make me." Take a good look into yourself, and if you love Things and the power and the plenitude of Things</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">better than you love your own dignity, human dignity, Oh, say so, say so! Say it to yourself, and abide by it. But do not blow hot and cold in one breath. Do not try to be a social reformer and a respected possessor of Things at the same time. Do not preach the straight and narrow</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">way while going joyously upon the wide one. Preach the wide one, or do not preach at all; but do not fool yourself by saying you would like to help usher in a free society, but you cannot sacrifice an armchair for it. Say honestly, "I love armchairs better than free men, and pursue</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">them because I choose; not because circumstances make me. I love hats, large hats, with many feathers and great bows; and I would rather have those hats than trouble myself about social dreams that will never be accomplished in my day. The world worships hats, and I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">wish to worship with them." 

But if you choose the liberty and pride and strength of the single soul, and the free fraternization of men, as the purpose which your life is to make manifest, then do not sell it for tinsel. Think that your soul is strong and will hold</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">its way; and slowly, through bitter struggle perhaps, the strength will grow. And the foregoing of possessions for which others barter the last possibility of freedom, will become easy. 

At the end of your life you may close your eyes, saying:</div></div>

I have proved by a lifetime that there is that in man which saves him from the absolute tyranny of Circumstance, which in the end conquers and re-moulds</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Circumstance, - the immortal fire of Individual Will, which is the salvation of the Future." 

Let us have Men, Men who will say a word to their souls and keep it - keep it not when it is easy, but keep it when it is hard - keep it when the storm roars and there is a white-</div></div>

Hold unto the last: that is what it means to have a Dominant Idea.</div></div>
