<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{5} In the days of Herod, king of Judaea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, and his wife, who were stricken in years yet had no child. And it came to pass that an angel of the Lord appeared saying, I am Gabriel. Fear not,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{35} And the angel</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And it came to pass, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph went into Bethlehem with Mary, being great with child. And there she brought forth her</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now when Jesus was born, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. And Herod the king enquired of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 49</a><div class="page-content">them, saying, Go and search diligently for the child, that I may worship him also.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{9} And, lo, the star went over where the young child was. And they were come into the house, and saw the child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 49</a><div class="page-content">and presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{13} And when they were departed, behold, an angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and flee. And they departed into</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{16} And Herod was exceeding wroth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, from two years old and under.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{19} But when Herod was dead, they arose, and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{21} And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising, his name was called JESUS and they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{42} And, again, when he was twelve years</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness, he preaching baptism of repentance, as it is written in the book of Esaias saying, The</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{21} Now it came to pass, that Jesus was baptized of John, and the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended like a dove upon him, and a voice came from</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days fasting and tempted of the devil. And the devil said, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone be made bread, and Jesus answered,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{14} And Jesus</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{31} And in Capernaum, he taught them, and they were astonished at his doctrine.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{33} And in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, saying, Jesus of</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{40} Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And it came to pass that he taught the people out of the ship belonging to Simon, upon the lake of Gennesaret. And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets. And Simon</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">forsook all, and followed him. And much went fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came to hear, and to be healed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{17} And when he was teaching, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy. And, because of</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>{21} And the scribes and the Pharisees said; Who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? But Jesus</div></div>
