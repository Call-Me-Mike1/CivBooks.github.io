By ChrisChrispie</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 34</a><div class="page-content">I first joined Civclassics in November of 2018. It was a much different server then, and I settled in Carpathia, then owned by Prioma. 

Carpathia under Prioma rule had several cities. Tugersburg, Dankhaven, Germantown, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content">another hidden city of which I will not disclose the location. Do know it exists though and it is underground. On 10/18/20 I decided to take a trip back to these lands to find this city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">THE START OF THE TRIP

Icenia's rail station is dated. Bathed in 70's mall nostalgia. The plan is to redo it to match the top, but it is an interesting aesthetic for right now. I hope on the 0,0 rail to get to the Carpathia rail. While no direct 0,0 rail exists</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">to Carpathia, one can hop on the rail to New Sovia and they'll be somewhat close. As you leave Icenia you are met by a massive swath of two way rails from both 0,0 and Imperial Truidence. They go under a strange hallowed out ice mountain biome known as "drippy" in Icenia due to its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">tendency to drip water. During construction of these rails, this proved to be an issue. Penal labor was used in part to dig this tunnel, and build these rails. Penal labor from the days of Bloom-Icenia tensions due to the bombings of Nyasaland and Tel Aviv by Pirater</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">and LordChieftain. I laugh at this because one ended up joining NATO in the war and the other is up for a judgeship in Icenia with Slushi's depature due to creating Ashlor in the +,+. We continue down the rail past old HJE rails, another relic of the past taken out in the last days of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Infinity War. These rails are still well maintained, though hardly used anymore. 

Slowly we make our way under Old Carbon and the Rubicon, builds from the very start of the world dotting the countryside of Icenia. If you've ever wanted to see true</div></div>

One break iron reinforcements. It's amazing. Most of it has been raided to hell, but it still a sight to see. I'm also reminded how close Imperial Truidence is to these ruins. In fact, Imperial Truidence used to be PART of them, named</div></div>

Part of the Westeros Empire and Ring of Essence, they would fall due to internal strife. But its a happy thought to think that ObtainableSpat, a newfriend to Classics, was able to craft a nation that would be involved in both the UNC, UDF, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">second major world war on the server and come out victorious despite the jokes against him. 

I enter 0,0. It is a beautiful build by Onii_Chan and a far cry from its past as a run down pit from different days. It's modern, sleak, and uses railswitch.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Icenia got this land from the Finglish-Icenia summit, brought together by Figasaur and Cr0c0dile when they still lived in Icenia during the JQ days. We switch rails to New Sovia and we're off. 

This is my first trip to New Sovia, a nation that Icenia was at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">war with for a short time during the summer of 2019. Icenia managed to get out of the war with a white peace, but it brought shame upon the nation and led to us eventually joining Entente in the Infinity War. I don't know what I'll see in New Sovia, but I'm excited to see it. TPS is tanking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Chunks are continuing to not load, a sign of poor technical mods on the server. It's been this way for a while and makes a terrible impression on players coming from Realms, which has just bit the dust due to a terrible war. I truly wish it was better.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">I stop along the rail to New Sovia deciding it better to boat to Dankhaven, which is now close to me. Stopping, I find an old set of stairs leading to the top of the bottom of a mesa biome near the Pinnicle stop on the west 0,0 rail. This is about 5000 blocks away from Icenia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Even here the signs of sand mining are evident. Still, turtles dot the small beach and a lava pool awaits to catch its next innocent newfriend much like Hjaltland.

After much searching I finally come across a boat at Lenin Isle, and take it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The boat trip is easy, and I land on a mushroom island next to dankhaven. This area is totally abandoned, but reinfocrements on chests have not decayed...a sign of recent activity. A house stands dark with no doors, and a bed sits in the open surrounded</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">by mushroom cows. It is dark. Onto Dankhaven.

I find the hidden town. Known as Nuke Town I was first shown this in 2018. Its evident these chunks haven't been loaded in 2 years. A furnace is still on making porkchops.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The entrance is hard to find but once entered, the world opens up to you. A face pours lava at me, looking deep into this pit there are countless rooms. Chests are loaded with building materials...these people went for aesthetics not for wealth</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">hallways with homes line the interior. I find a spawnbook from a man called "totallytrustable".

Theres a underground church with a gold doorway. 

It was at this point the author died due to bad TPS and went back to get his book</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">and spawnbook he found back. 

After the return journey I found that the Red Rock Guild was active as of April 2020, but no work had been done on their fortress in any meaningful sense since I had last visited it in 2018 when
I saw their people</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">online. I then set out to explore more lands. Coming across an old half finished house, I found a spawnbed, and nothing more. This was Northwest of Carpathia. The trees stood out in the flatlands. I continued. On the badlands east of Taugersburg heading toward Freedonia, I found</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">a half destroyed Carpathian outpost. This had to have dated to start of the world. Its roof and one side was gone. Abandoned and hit from creepers.

I walk into Freedonia. Its underground canals give it away. The original owners called it a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">sewer system. These canals extend deep into the town itself and connect all the apartment buildings there. Drab communist blocks with no design to them at all. The WIP Red Hall is still there and the Freedonia flag, a red and black anarchist flag, flies proudly over the city</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">still. This land had many owners, one being the Brotherhood of Steel ran by Youraveragerick, who would himself eventually wind up in Columbia and turn into a casulty of the infinity war before claiming overship over the HJE territory. I don't know where he's gone now.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The city is mostly devoid of any wealth. Its all been taken out by its many owners, but the buildings still stand tall and the roads are clear of any destruction. We continue North from here.

The next city I visit is Vacari, defined by its much more classic</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">German build style than its neighbor Freedonia. Entering Vacari it clear that they have a poor outskirts and a rich city center, but like Icenia. Many of the buildings are heavily decayed, but some still exist well here. Most are broken into, like most cities I have been to so far.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">There was some books here, a religious one. The railstation in Vacari is small and has two destinations, one leading to a regional hub that includes a 0,0 rail to Iria among other things. I continue north toward Appomatix. 

I take the train to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">their small farming outpost to check it out. The land here becomes more hilly, and the tracks swoop out of a mesa bioma, across a bridge, and down into a simple cave station.

Appomatix is surrounded by two towns. One a port town with three buildings</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">and the other a farm outpost with map art in red. The fishing town is the closest city to Ceylon, or New Sovia. Its buildings are named after prominant 3rd Reich members of the Weirmacht (Romel for example).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Appomatix itself is uniquely southern and has the best capitol building on the server I've seen to date. It's government buildings are in beautiful order. Quartz done well. 

I take the rail from Appomatix to Nyasaland. It is here that server infrastructure</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 34</a><div class="page-content">picks back up again from the badlands I had been traveling through. You can get to anywhere from Appomatix really. Nyasaland is the key though and its been switched over to railswitch, so you can go to 0,0 from there or Gabon or Taiozi, so three nations of importance on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 34</a><div class="page-content">server. The railswitch to Gabon itself is a large, diagonal, lit railway with other connections on it. 

I continue down my path toward this city and back to Icenia. It's been a long trip and I'm happy to be returning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 34</a><div class="page-content">I roll into Gabon, which is currently active and four people greet me. Their station is beautiful. 

There is a direct line here to Icenia. I take it and soon its back to the Republic again. This was a good trip.
