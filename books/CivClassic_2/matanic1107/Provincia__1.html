<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In our previous book, the ancient people drew on their creation myth to answer the problem of evil and to give themselves a purpose. They thought that they were all social souls and that to survive one must survive with others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Oddly enough, while most religions in this world advocate a clear-cut code of morality and right action, the faith of these people had no such purpose. Their religion was one of communal bonding but also one of manipulation and acceptance for</div></div>

Their religion was not seen as a supreme moral code but simply how the universe worked</div></div>

In this Tablet, the sequel to the creation myth, we see the story of the man, the</div></div>

This tablet also explains the origin of the race of gods that these people attempted to have manipulate the reality strings for them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">This is a story of ambition, love, and cruelty. This is the Story of The Pondering Man.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2. The Soul of Chaos and the Soul of Warmth warred for their souls eternally, sometimes winning but never for long.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">3. Humanity set up many villages and many cities on the banks of many rivers. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>5. Most men looked down at the dirt beneath them, the grass on the ground, the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>6. They farmed for their life, were given in marriage to others, and cried, sang, and died, never once turning their eyes toward what is above.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>7. This man did so as the others yet</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">always pondered on what is above the people on this Earth.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>8. On the Day of Rest, the man did not sing, or sleep, or talk with his family, or eat, or drink, or engage in pleasure with others.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>9. The man pondered on what is above and what this life is.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">10. The man pondered like this for may Days of Rest until the villagers mocked him, calling him "The Pondering Man."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>11. "Look at this fool," they would say, "For he has a beautiful wife, a fertile field, jars full of wine, and aurochs in his barn, yet</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">instead of enjoying these great pleasures he sits in his room, doing nothing! Might he be senile before his time? Might his wife be an unchaste woman? Might his children resent his character?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>12. Yet the man continued to ponder on life's mysteries,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">alone in his room. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>13. The Pondering Man sat alone, thinking of the mysteries of this world, yet while closing his eyes, he caught a vision of something beautiful.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>14. Thousands of brilliant, vibrant strings dancing and playing before his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">very eyes, twisting themselves into elaborate patterns yet never becoming tangled. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>15. The man gazed into their beauty and wept, for he had never seen anything so pure and beautiful in his life. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>16. Their beauty then ceased before his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">very eyes, and he wept, for he had lost something already dear to him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>17. The pondering man told everyone he knew of this beautiful sight he had seen in his vision. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>18. He said, "I was meditating in my room, and behold, I saw a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">beautiful arrangement of the threads of this Universe. They shimmered and danced, they wove yet they never tangled, and their color was more brilliant than even the most beautiful assortment of flowers on this world."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>19. Yet the villagers continued to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">mock him, saying, "Look at this man. How senile must he be to perceive such outlandish sights! For he loses himself in this imaginary world of his, forgetting the fun and revelry one may have in this current world! Perhaps he has consumed too many strange</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">mushroom from the mountain?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>20. The man was deeply grieved by this vicious chatter, but he continued to ponder the mysteries of life, and danced and sang with the beautiful strings on the next plane of existence.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>21. One day, a flood</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">devastated the village.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>22. Many lives were lost, and many homes were destroyed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>23. The pondering man's wife and children perished in the flood, and deeply grieved at this event.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>24. He sought to ponder the nature of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">pain and chaos, and he escaped into the world of cosmic strings he had seen many times before. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>25. However, the Strings were ugly, tangled, and colorless.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>26. On the Seventh Plane of Existence, the Soul of the Universe cried with delight,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">while the soul of the Sun wept with love. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>27. The pondering man reached out to a thick string closer to his heart than the others that had been, and wove it into one again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>28. The string became colorful and vibrant again, but ceased its dancing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 24</a><div class="page-content">as it was near four more severed, gray strings.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>29. The man untangled and wove these strings whole again, and they danced with the other string. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>30. The pondering man awoke from this vision, and his wife and children had become</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 24</a><div class="page-content">alive after this event. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>25. They offered their comfort to him and the other survivors of the disastrous flood.</div></div>
