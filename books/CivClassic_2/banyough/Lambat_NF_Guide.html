We've noticed that you are a newfriend (NF) to this server. So, we have decided to write this simple book that can help you learn about the basics of 'living' in this fun server.

First, let's talk about FACTORIES!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">How do we use factories?

- You need a: STICK -
You should have a stick on your right hand. LEFT CLICK the crafting table, and factory options will show up. Select which option you desire, and close once done. Turn on the furnace using LEFT CLICK and it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">will start running. REMEMBER: You'll have to put CHARCOALS as it fuels the factories.

Factory health: Factories can be in disrepair. If this happens, you'll have to repair the factories with their required materials for repairing. If you don't know how to, you can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">message banyough/kaprediem so they can repair the factories. Please do not hesitate to notify them!

Do we need factories?
Yes! They make block/item production easier, faster and they produce more quantities. There are items in this server</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">that you cannot obtain naturally. So, you'll have to craft them using the factories with their required materials. You can see the recipe by hovering your mouse in the item you want to craft. There are many types of factories and you can check /fm . (Factories will have signs anyway)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">- REINFORCING - 

What is Reinforcing and why do we need to reinforce our stuff?

Reinforcements are important if we want our valuables secured and protected. In this server, there are raiders/griefers that waste their time des-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">troying blocks just so you'll have a bad day. There are three items you can use for reinforcing:

-Stone (50 hits)
-Iron (300 hits)
-Diamond (2000 hits)

Stone is used commonly since it is easier to obtain. You can reinforce your</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">house with stone only and that should not be a problem.

Irons and Diamonds can be used for more valuable bloccs like chests, and a special chest you want secured. Really depends on you.

How do I reinforce?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Command: /ctr

CTReinforce is the option where you reinforce items manually. If you've already placed a block, you will use this to reinforce each block you've placed. Either left or right click is good. If you are building for the government, make</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">sure to reinforce under: 
- Lambat
- LambatInfra
The command for reinforcing on a group should be like this:
/ctr LambatInfra
/ctr Lambat
Only typing /ctr will make it reinforce blocks only for yourself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Command: /ctf

CTFortify is used to reinforce your items the same time as you place the blocks. You'll have to hold the stone/iron/diamond, and type /ctf and it will automatically reinforce your items as long as you have s/i/d in your inventory. It will auto-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">matically turn itself off if you run out of s/i/d.

How to turn off the commands after using:

Type: /ctoff

How to check if a block is reinforced or not:

Type: /ctin</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">This should help you start learning about the basics of this server. Remember, just be nice to everyone and stay wholesome. Do not cause any trouble!
