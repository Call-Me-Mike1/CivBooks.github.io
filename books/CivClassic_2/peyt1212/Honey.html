It has since baffled us in every way, from its strange healing properties to its ability to last thousands of years without a hint of rot, immortal in its golden splendor.</div></div>

Fine by me.
There she is. It's been a while, I have to say. She had once again changed, trading her raven locks for those of gold, the gentle swing of which revealed the honey sweet scent beneath.</div></div>
