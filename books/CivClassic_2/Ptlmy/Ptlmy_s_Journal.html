           Part 1:
    The First Library



   By Ptlmy, formerly         Sprocketlord</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I write this, having written many times before. Once, out of desire for meaning. Later, privileged to write as a career. Now, having reached an advanced age, I have picked up the pen again to tell my own story. It is a story of three worlds, and so I will tell it in three parts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Long ago, in a world much different than the one I find myself in today, I stumbled upon a place of great symbolic power. This world was without law and order, and the gods were silent regardless of your faith. 

The place I had found was the Library.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I found the Library by accident. Today, most things in this world are mapped and recorded. There is very little to just stumble upon. But there, in the oldest of worlds, I had stumbled upon the Library. It was a discovery that would change my life, from a scavenger to a scholar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Scavenging for food in the desert, a habit I had grown accustomed to as a young man. To settle down was certain death. To roam was the way. 

We navigated by radio signal. Great iron towers broadcasting looping phrases across the barren landscape.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">A fool built a radio in his home, and was quick to be driven out first by armed marauders, then by scavengers like myself. The only use of such devices was to preserve a legacy on the airwaves long after all but your iron tower had been destroyed. It was a cowards means to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">preserve a legacy in the world. The alternative was to die a hero, and be written into legend.

Death itself permeated the land. There were no jails, no great vaults like those built today. Death was the only means of exacting anything resembling justice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">To my uncivilized eyes, the Library looked to be a good source of raw material. It was a great structure, buried under the sand. By modern standards it was rather sparse and modest, but it in the first world it was megalithic. Crafted from hewn sandstone and stacked high</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">with bookshelves. As my reckless, youthful eyes gazed upon the great atrium, dimly lit by scattered glowstone lanterns, I only saw raw materials ripe for looting. And so I began to disassemble the library, brick by brick. I tore through bookshelves and chests, shattered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">glass and glowstone, and ripped up the tile on the floor. 

But as I smashed through one chest, I found something old and leatherbound. A book. With writing inside, no less. I had never seen such a thing in my time scavenging, and so I kept it. A small trinket</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">to remember this great place, once built, then abandoned, now destroyed, and since erased.

The book was titled "The Days Swept Away" and recounted the tale of a lost civilization called Atoll. It became my sole quest to find this place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Atoll was described at the time as a paradise. The sandy beaches and green mountains were said to be far from the mainland, where marauders did not go and where farming was a viable means of making a living. Suffice to say, I searched for this place for quite some time. Though none had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">heard of the place, and many thought me mad to pursue a lost city with such fervor. I once thought I had found it, but was disappointed to find a floating city inhabited by pirates. It was said in the text that Atoll was ruled by a mad king, and equally mad was the pirate leader, but he had not heard</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">of Atoll either. Having searched across the land, and spent a great deal of my youth in such pursuit, I finally had given up. The lost city would remain lost, as soon a great cataclysm would put an end to that world and send me on to wander a new one. But I held on to the story of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Days Swept Away, painstakingly copied from book to notepad, and as such it is the only surviving text from that old world before the great cataclysm put it out of its misery.

It would seem then that destiny had made me the sole bearer of Atoll's legacy. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">story would not die with me though. It became my token of entry into a new world, one which I will describe and recount in a second journal or perhaps two. 

I will also tell you about the great conjunction of events that let me play a small role in the world</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">and of how I met St. Marcus. I will tell you about the failure of the Haven library, and about Haven itself. I will tell you about TealNerd, and Fellowship, and a great sea under the earth. But these stories take time to do proper justice to, and thus now I must rest my pen. Until next time.</div></div>
