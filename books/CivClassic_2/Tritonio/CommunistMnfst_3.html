<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by</div></div>
