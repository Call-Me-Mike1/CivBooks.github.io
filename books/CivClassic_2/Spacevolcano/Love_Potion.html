<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Students of Hogwarts! Welcome to a new school year. Before we start the sorting I would like to introduce you all to an exchange student from the Augustan Academy for the magical arts. Please give a warm welcome to Bailey! <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">She is due to begin her seventh year of magical training. She will be the first to be sorted.” Said Dumbledore. The girl named Bailey rose from her seat on the end of the teacher’s table and sat down on the <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>stool.Professor<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> McGonagall placed the sorting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">hat on Bailey's head.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Hmmmm. I see you possess large amounts of courage that I have seen in only one other. A fair brain, lots of potential…well, better be GRYFFINDOR!” said the sorting hat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The table erupted with cheers as Bailey walked over to sit with her new house.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Lysika couldn’t believe his eyes when he first caught sight of the girl.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She was beautiful. She had long shiny blondy hair and deep blue eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">But that wasn’t what had entranced Lysika. There was something about her that intrigued him, but he couldn’t seem to put his finger on it. He waited for Dumbledore to finish his speech and for the first years to be sorted.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">When Dumbledore finally said, “Tuck in” he laughed and banged his skull spectre as Ron eagerly grabbed food off the nearest platter. “Honestly Ronald, didn’t your mother teach you manners” scolded Hermione. “Oh, she tried. Never did'</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">work thou'.” Said Ron through a mouth full of food. Hermione gave him a disgusted look as she politely served herself some food.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She then turned to Bailey who was sitting on the other side of the table in front of Lysika.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Hello, my name’s Hermione, this is Ron and this is Lysika.” She said pointing to herself and the two boys. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“H-Hi, I’m Bailey” the girl said shyly. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Bailey looked at the boy named Lysika and she sucked in her breath.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It was he, the boy-who-lived. Even in Chanada - they had heard of him. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Are you guys in seventh year too?” Bailey asked. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The trio nodded their heads in response. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“So I guess we’ll be in some classes together, aye niggers?” she said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Yeah, er, what are you training to become when you leave Hogwarts?” grined Lysika. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Well, I was planning on becoming a base bitch” Bailey responded. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Cool, that’s what I’m training to be too.” winked Lysika.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">There was an awkward silence. “Umm…I guess I should go and settle in,” said Bailey nervously. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“That’s silly, you don’t even know where the common room is!” exclaimed Hermione. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“I’ll take her,” offered Lysika.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Ron and Hermione both turned to him, identical looks of shock on their faces. “Thanks! I forgot about that,” said Bailey cheerfully. Lysika and her got up and walked out of the Great hall, many pairs of eyes following them out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“So does your family still live in Chanada?” Lysika asked, attempting to make conversation. Bailey was staring at the ground. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“I don’t have any family. My parents are dead and I have no siblings,” she said, her voice shaking slightly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Lysika lowered his eyes in shame. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“I’m such an idiot, yah Lysika, way to be smooth about it. Sure, just bring up dead relatives, that’s a great way to get a girl to like you, quickly, adjust your scarf” Lysika thought. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Sorry” he whispered apologetically to her. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“No it’s fine. Is this the common room here?” she asked when Lysika stopped outside the fat lady’s portrait. He nodded in response. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“A new year” he said to her.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The portrait swung open and Bailey sucked in her breath in surprise. Lysika grinned. Yes, the Gryffindor common room was wonderful. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Thanks for showing me here” said Bailey as she started up the stairs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Oh, no problem. If you need help finding any of your classes you can ask me.” <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Bailey blushed at Lysika’s statement. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Well, goodnight” she said as she disappeared through the dormitory door. Lysika sat down in front of the common room fire. He stared into the fire as he waited for Ron and Hermione to return from the Great Hall.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">THE NEXT DAY<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Welcome to tryouts for the Gryffindor Quittich team” said Lysika to the group of students assembled before him. It was exactly one week since school had begun and Lysika was anxious to get onto his skullbolt. He was the captain again,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> for the second year in a row.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Today I’m looking for two new chasers” he was said when a figure rushed onto the pitch. Lysika was preparing to give her a talk about lateness when he caught sight of her face. It was Bailey.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">His face softened into a silly grin.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Sorry I’m late” she said apologetically.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“It’s fine. Don’t worry” He finally snapped out of his daze and returned his attention to the hopefuls in front of him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Okay, we’ll start with a warm-up lap around the pitch. From there I’ll start to eliminate people,” said Lysika as he mounted his broomstick and kicked off the ground. Everyone else followed suit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He flew for a few seconds then stopped in the air and surveyed the other people trying out. Some of them could hardly fly, some were ok, but his eyes were immediately drawn to Bailey. She was amazing! She had never mentioned that she played Quittich!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">They had talked a lot during the week and Lysika had discovered that they had many similarities. Now he could add Quittich to the long list. Lysika quickly brought his mind back to the try-outs and signalled for everyone to land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He sent away the people who weren’t good flyers or who he knew wouldn’t make it later on. There were five people left, Bailey, Folters, and a first year Weepee. He turned to address them,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Great job guys! Nox, will surly suffer after this one! Now, It will be Ginny, Bailey, and Aerothers as the chasers, me as the keeper and Xavter as the beater for the first team. Jake, Folters and dean as chasers for the other team,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Ron as keeper and Sempha as beater. Now lets get started!” he hopped onto his skullbolt and took his place in front of the goal hoops.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Two hours later Lysika blew his whistle to end the game.  He beckoned to Ginny, jake, Ron and Sempha</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Ok guys, so who do guys think would be good chasers for us?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“That Bailey girl was really good!” said Ginny. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Ginny and Bailey together had creamed the other team in the game.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“I thought Xavter was surprisingly good too” spoke up Ron. The team nodded in response. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“I though Folters was good!” supplied Xavter.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Xavter, deal with it! I know Folters’s your friend and all but he just isn’t good enough,” said Ron angrily.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Xavter shot him an angry glare.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Ok, settle down guys! So then do we all agree that it’s Bailey and Folters?” Everyone except Ron nodded. After a glare from Ginny, Xavter reluctantly nodded too. He knew better then to anger a Weasley.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Okay great!” said Lysika, he was secretly rejoicing. He was looking forward to seeing Bailey more.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Wait! What am I thinking? What is wrong with me! I’m not falling in…. NO! Never! Bailey is just my friend! Yes that’s all!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">MOMENTS LATER<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Lysika! Calling Lysika_Lantariel?!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Huh? What what’s going on?” Lysika asked finally coming out of his trance to find himself facing a confused Ginny.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“ How nice of you to join us Mr. Lantariel!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> I was saying that we should go tell them now. They’re starting to squirm”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Oh, yah Ginny, right,” stuttered Lysika. He walked with Ginny to where the others were gathered. Ginny shot him another confused glance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> He just ignored it, grateful that no one around could read his thoughts.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Well, you guys all did a great job! But we decided that Bailey and Lavender would be our new chasers. Congratulations!” said Lysika</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Folters, and Xavter both walked away with disappointed looks on their faces. However Bailey jumped up and hugged Lysika. Lysika was taken aback. He hadn’t been expecting that. Suddenly Bailey realised what she was doing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and quickly pulled away from Lysika, blushing. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Sorry!” she whispered, while staring at the ground. Lysika just gave her an encouraging smile that seemed to cheer her up. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Okay, I’ll post our practice dates on the message board,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> so be on the lookout for them. You can go now. Good job everyone!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The team turned to depart to the changerooms. However, Lysika gently touched Bailey’s shoulder and she turned around. “Yes Lysika?” she asked,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">clearly still embarrassed by earlier.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Umm… I was wondering if I could speak with you?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Yah, sure”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“You did really great today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> You never told me that you played Quittich,” he said while Bailey and him sat down under a tree by the lake.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Yah, in my old school we had a meme team. It was really only for fun though.. So we would just have little war games once a month with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> some practices in-between. Way Different from here aye nigger?” <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Lysika laughed when she said that. He had heard that Chanadians said “nigger” a lot. When he looked at her she looked hurt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Oh, no, I wasn’t laughing at your school traditions. I was just laughing at how you said nigger. I didn’t mean to offend you”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Her expression immediately softened and she broke out into giggles. “Oh! That’s what you thought was funny.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Yah, sort of a habit’’ she said still giggling. Lysika couldn’t help himself. He started laughing too and soon they were both rolling around on the grass laughing. When they calmed down Lysika turned to look at Bailey. “Look at those gorgeous eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">She is so beautiful. She’s so funny and nice too… Lysika, now don’t you start that again, you don’t even know if she likes you!” <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Lysika shook himself out of his daze quickly, not wanting to scare Bailey by staring at her..</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“What I really wanted to talk to you about was this group that I started in my fifth year. It’s called the MA or Mirian <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Army...Oh<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>, the reason for the name’s a long story” he said when he saw her confused look.</div></div>
