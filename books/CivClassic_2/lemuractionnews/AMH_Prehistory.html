Prehistory Exhibit

The era of Apolish history from before the arrival of Lemur and the grots has few sources. Much of what we know is from Shadedoom and KnotNSA as well as scattered archeological clues.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Nevertheless, what follows is a telling of Apolish history from the earliest known details to the establishment of the second empire of Columbia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The Island of Apoland was generated as a plains biome. This is somewhat rare for this part of the map. 

Most of Hallow and mainland Columbia is extreme hills and forest. 

Where Apoland Proper sits now, originally was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">a Villager village. 

According to old maps, the rest of the island was mostly devoid of trees, but this could have been part of an early attempt at colonization by the new swedish or another group.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">some believe that a few of the buildings in downtown Apoland are actually remnants of the village that have been modified, but there is little evidence of this.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The island laid essentially untouched until the summer of 2017, when the Grand Duchy of Columbia settled Rotterdam, and claimed the island.

Apoland was claimed by Furst Shadedoom to be his personal estate. He named it Cascadia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Despite this, Shade did not develop the island. He soon lapsed into a state of inactivity and the island languished.

A month or two passed and it was soon forgotten that Shade had claimed the island. 
Then Shade returned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He found his land had been settled on and granted to another fursten, Aposii and Green_trump. 

They had named their colony Apolland.

An argument ensued. The settlers didn't know that they were living on claimed land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">By this time, they already had started building. The other noblemen of Columbia reasoned it would be unfair to kick them out.

But Shade had been a founding member of the country. He only dropped his claim to the island when he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">was offered another island in the south of the country. He called this one Letzebuerg.

Now, Apo and Green continued creating their colony. 

They bulldozed most of the village. They built a dock and several small shacks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">They built the windmill and, most importantly, they tilled a large field on the south of the island.

This was important because Apoland was expected to pay taxes to the capital, which took the form of food production.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">They mostly grew carrots and potatoes. 
Then, things get a little hard to track down. All we know is that Apo and green came into a large sum of wealth. 

One may think they simply must have mined it. After all, in this time,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Apo and green did mine a lot to create their rail network.

Yet, their mining strategy (as observed in present day) is completely inadequate to yield any large sum of diamonds or any other ore for that matter.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">All we know is that they had riches... and they did not want to share a single diamond.

Evidently, the other noblemen found out about their newfound wealth. They demanded that they pay a portion to help the rest of the duchy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Green and especially Apo himself refused with vitriol. 

The noblemen persisted. Feeling that they would attempt to steal from him, according to legend, Aposii gathered all of their massive wealth and dropchested it somewhere close or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">maybe even in Apoland. Treasure hunters have been trying to find it to this day.

With that, Apo and green went inactive, not wanting to play with the country they felt had tried to extort them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The grand duchy soon became the short lived first empire, which fell into inactivity near the end of 2017. It was eventually disbanded that year.

Apoland lay vacant that entire time. Eventually being claimed by lusitania</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Apoland laid empty until a few months after Columbia returned to civclassics in the form of the second empire in summer 2018.

lemur didn't think much of the island, but appreciated its serene calm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">About a month after that, Apo and green came back and attempted to reconcile with the other Columbians.

At first, Apo and green hit it off with their old pals. They got back to work building.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">they built a castle on the southern end of the island and several houses. 

But it didn't last, as the Columbians once again asked about the now fabled dropchested riches.

In response, apo and green left once again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 25</a><div class="page-content">After events discussed in the lemur exhibit, lemur became a prominent member of the country. 

As Apo and green seemed to have quit the game for the last time, lemur was granted Apoland as his personal estate on january 30th, 2019</div></div>
