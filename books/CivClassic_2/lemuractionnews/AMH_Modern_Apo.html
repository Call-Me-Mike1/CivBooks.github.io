Modern Apoland Exhibit

Modern Apolish history begins with Lemur's acquisition of Apoland in early 2019; however, much of 2019 and 2020 was spent in the infinity war. There is an entire exhibit about this period in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">basement. 

This exhibit is about modern Apoland, disregarding the war.

Lemur's founding principles of Apoland were freedom of expression and security for builders and roleplayers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">This spirit was fostered in Lemur as a result of being denied to build in Rotterdam, a city with a strict build code.

Many of Rotterdam's former denizens made fun of Apoland's lax
building laws.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">They called it a shithole full of terrible builds.

Rather than fight this inaccuracy, Lemur instead chose to lean into the joke. Eventually, those people saw the value and virtue of Apoland.</div></div>

Honestly, it's turned into something of a culture, a weird mixture of medieval peasantry and</div></div>

Supposedly, all the peasants speak Finnish and all the gangsters speak Spanish. This is why Apoland is tri-lingual.

The kingdom of Apoland has expanded to cover much of the land around the northwest of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 8</a><div class="page-content">empire. Apoland is not small and irrelevant anymore. 

In reality, those who come to Apoland come to have a fun and chill time building and rp'ing in peace.</div></div>

Long flag of Apoland
with three plants in its wake. The three plants are all different, signifying the diversity of builds and people, all yearning for freedom. 

They find it in the Apolish flag</div></div>
