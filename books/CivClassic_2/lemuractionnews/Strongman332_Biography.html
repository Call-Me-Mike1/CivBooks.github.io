<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He showed me screenshots and designs for a fortress in a Minecraft world where people had to work to destroy blocks -</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was fascinated; I bought my Minecraft account that very day. I had played several times before on his account,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>but Civcraft was different.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I needed to join under my own name and make an identity for myself. After buying the account and giving it my<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>usual name of Strongman332, I logged into Civcraft and found myself northwest of Mt Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 36</a><div class="page-content">At that time is was not much more than a few houses, a flying saucer, and a large castle. At this point I found my first melon patch. I harvested the melons, then planted several more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I would need the melons because I knew I had a long way to go in order to find Atlantis. This was where my friend HiddenSage had been living and working for several weeks - at that underwater maze of a city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 36</a><div class="page-content">After gathering the last of the precious food, I headed off to the nether. I found myself in a hellish world - everything was chaos. There were 1-block wide paths that snaked off into the distance - tunnels dug in to the walls. It was a maze.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Luckily, before me there were two signs. The first said "this way to Anstopohs" which was at the time nothing more than<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>an abandoned cobblestone town, covered in lava.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The other, much more relevant sign, said "this way to Agora."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Thanks to that sign<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I set off along a relativly (for the time) well made path. The path wound its way past lava water falls, several sections had been destroyed by ghasts, Others were simply marked by stone pillars.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 36</a><div class="page-content">The path eventually lead me to The Nexus, a dilapidated shopping center at the entrance of the ruined city Cress.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I found yet another sign. leading to Agora proper.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 36</a><div class="page-content">After arriving in Agora, I was quickly disappointed. There were only three buildings and a ton<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>of empty land.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I gathered more melons and set off for Atlantis.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 36</a><div class="page-content">After I passing over the last of the solid land before you hit the ocean that covers the northeastern part of the 1.0 map, I discovered a small farming town - Lazuli. The small town would later grow into the second largest city on the server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 36</a><div class="page-content">They provided me a boat, a bed, and food. Giving my thanks,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I set off for my destination. Pressing forward, I soon discovered why they called it a hidden city. I was lost. I cried for help, but I received no response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 36</a><div class="page-content">So I logged off and had HiddenSage email me the coords. After getting my directions, I found I was almost on top of the city. I entered the city via water elevator and met with HiddenSage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 36</a><div class="page-content">We did not stay long, however, and left<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>for Columbia as HiddenSage had a business partner in the city. We set off to Agora, which was the closest nether portal at the time. From here we attempted to use<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>a confusing path called the northwest passage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Well, we got lost, went back to Agora, and found a path that said "to Columbia." Thirty minutes later we were there - in a city I would soon call home. It was the largest city I had ever seen on the server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 36</a><div class="page-content">We did not stay long. We were off to Atlantis again. As we passed through Agora, I made a decision. I was going to make a road, larger and faster than any before.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I decided not to continue to Atlantis.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I built a small homestead, and a tree farm. I used the trees to make tools, and set about mining cobblestone. I was going to need a lot of it. After making 10 or so double chests of pickaxes and 30 stacks of melon, I was ready. My plan wasn't.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I sat and talked with Sage. We knew the location of several portals, but we only knew of three populated cities actually connected to the nether. I took the coordinates of these cities, found the midpoint between them, and entered it into my minimap.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I averaged the height of all known portals. My roads were going to be flat and built at y=63. So I started digging from Agora to what would be known as The Nether Hub. Soon I discovered<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was not ready.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I needed a sword. Ghast were common in early 1.0.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 36</a><div class="page-content">With my new sword in hand, I started digging. I was about 10 blocks in when Sage showed up to help. We dug 2km towards The Nether Hub before his class. I pressed on - refining my technique as I went.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 36</a><div class="page-content">That first set of roads was rough cut, but they worked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Soon I arrived at<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Nether Hub, which I discovered to just happen to be a nether fortress. I did not have time to stop. I turned toward Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I then realized I had been digging for 6 hours, and I had class in the morning. That was the end of my first day on the server. The next day between classes I finished the road to Mt Augusta - leaving the last bit walled off.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Finally, I turned toward Columbia. It was the longest of the tunnels. I was nearly finished when I<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>was attacked by four ghasts and nearly died. That's when I realized that all of the roads needed to be covered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Using what was left of my day, I covered all of the roads - forming 5km of tunnels. I would finish the Columbia tunnel on the third day. At the beginning of the third day, I connected the tunnels to the cities and placed signs and directions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I also, at the last moment, learned of the portal at 0,0. So I quickly dug a road reaching towards the center of the world. The roads were now finished but I wasn't.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I assume, by default, that the average person is a moron.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 36</a><div class="page-content">I know that most people are not actually dumb, but I always be mindful of the lowest of the low when making my plans. So I made a "beautiful" map by hand, and created a long, well-written<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>post describing the roads and their destinations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 36</a><div class="page-content">It was an instant hit with the server, but it was far from perfect. The roads required constant maintenance as I did not have the time to reinforce them. We had land mines placed on the roads. It was a constant fight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 36</a><div class="page-content">All of that changed when Hpoom came along. He had something I didn't -<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
