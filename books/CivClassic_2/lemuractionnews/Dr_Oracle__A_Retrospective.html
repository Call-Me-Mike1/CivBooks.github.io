<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 20</a><div class="page-content">    The second age of Civcraft was a time wrought in distrust. The memory of the HCF wars was fresh in many players' minds, the Nox war was brewing, and alts lay in wait around every corner.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">    It was for those reasons that I, having logged in for the first time ever, had trouble getting people to trust me, let me settle in their civs, to enjoy the game how it was meant to be played. I became a homeless wanderer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">   That is, until I floated into a town called Aytos.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    The usual mistrust was still there. They asked me if I was an alt like so many times before; however, this time there was another voice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">The other voice belonged to Dr_Oracle and he was welcoming me to town.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    What happened next has been blurred by time, but what I do remember is that Oracle's faith was a catalyst for my love of the Civcraft genre.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content">He opened the door to a whole new world for me. It wasn't until much later that I realized how truly one of a kind this event was.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   When it comes to the Civcraft genre, Oracle is like Forrest Gump. He is everywhere.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">   In the earliest days of the first era, he was instrumental in establishing Kizantium. He served on the fabled 'road crew', and not only did he  serve in the HCF war, but he pioneered the foogotti bunker,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">which protected countless lives against the HCF hordes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   If you look at screenshots of any major event of the first era, it's likely you'll see him or one of his alts. Oracle is ubiquitous.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">    This is what makes my own history with him seem all the more surreal. It feels like bumping into some famous actor at a Starbucks and not even knowing who they are until later.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">    At the time I wandered into Aytos, as Oracle would tell me later, the town was beset with border conflicts and griefing. Alts were a huge issue for the town.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I must've looked extremely suspicious, and he was taking a huge risk by trusting me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">   Eventually I moved on from Aytos and the second era ended.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    Oracle moved between Concordia and Augusta in the third Era of Civcraft. When that brief period of time was over, and the realm of Civcraft was abandoned,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">he made his way to civclassics.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    He toiled, at first in the HJE and Southshire, and then sometime in 2016, Oracle moved to New Yoahtl City, where he resides at the time of writing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">    It was in the winter that following year that, merely by chance, I would log into civclassics for the first time.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    Admittedly, I had forgot most of the time I had spent in Aytos.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">The years following, I had spent my time in other civ servers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   Yet, even though<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I couldn't quite remember at first,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>it wasn't long until Oracle had jogged<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>my memory.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">I told him I was extremely surprised he remembered everything after almost three years. With characteristic wit, he replied,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   "You have a very memorable name."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">   Without a doubt, Oracle is a controversial figure in Civcraft history. A quick google search could tell you all you need to know about that. Yet, above all else in my eyes, he is a comrade in arms,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   I asked Oracle why he comes back to Civcraft after all these years. He had this to say to me,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content">   "The people I've played with in 1.0 and 2.0 are mostly gone now, but I've always been able to find a new group to join.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
