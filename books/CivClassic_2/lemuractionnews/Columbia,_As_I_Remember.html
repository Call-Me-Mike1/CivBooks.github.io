What could I do other than strap in and hold on for that wild ride?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   That is how I'll always remember Columbia, as a big wild ride driven by people who were larger than life.</div></div>

It's not an overstatement to say that he is the reason Columbia even exists right now. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   The entire foundation that lead to the nation's return to civclassics was laid by him. Countless hours of</div></div>

A steady voice of reason in the stormy passion of the group.    Where shadedoom could often show his temper, Knot was always there to blunt the sharpness of his words.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    Whenever we would voice chat, he could pull out story after story like some sort of bard or drunk grandpa. Each tale was either amazing, hilarious, or both.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">   Then there is Vice Chancellor Hamboy, a man more dedicated to Columbia than maybe anyone else. The work he puts in is truly astounding. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   And there is Sirboss, haeccity, baes, Imperial, and so many more strange and flambouyant people.</div></div>
