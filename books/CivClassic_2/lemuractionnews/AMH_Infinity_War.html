Infinity War Era Exhibit

Shortly after Lemur was granted Apoland as an estate, Shade informed him that he would have to evacuate.

NATO had gone to war with Mir.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Lemur was sad, he had to break all his factories and burn all his stone. 

But it was a good move because it was only a few weeks before, just south of Apoland, the sieges of Sempiternal raged. 

NATO abandoned Columbia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Lemur and the rest of the Columbians were turned into refugees. They fled for their lives to the hallow vault. 

Hallow and the rest of NATO seemed entirely unwilling to try to liberate Columbia.

Lemur resented this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">but carried on. There was a war to be won, after all. Lemur tried various things in an attempt to fight back in the defence of Hallow. 

Every time, Hantzu and the rest of NATO refused to help and derided him. 

Lemur grew angry</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">at them, but carried on. 

Eventually, he was pearled defending Hallow vault. He was chastized and shit talked.

It dawned on Lemur that NATO was never about protecting Columbia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">So Lemur left Hallow vault, and went back to his home in Apoland.

After all, there was no danger to him. He was pearled. 

He had a plan. Mir didn't know anything about Apoland. They hadn't even put down a single snitch here.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He and KnotNSA planned to create a fortress, an entrenched city that could keep the unpearled columbians and their buildings safe. 

And so they set out to dig the first apoland trench. Unfortunately,
they were no defense
experts...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">though well intentioned, the first Apoland trench curved and twisted to fit the nooks and crannies of the city. 

Lemur did this because he thought it would save parts of his home from being torn apart, but in the end it made the trench
unusable.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Shadedoom told him this when he begged him to visit in the middle of the war. 

In response, Lemur installed several emergency logout bunkers around the city. The idea being that if Mirians came, one could simply drop into them and have enough time to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">logout before you were pearled. 

Shade pointed out that, even if they worked, your account would most likely get log boxed. 

Nevertheless, these acted as the city's main defense along with the trench-turned-fall</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">-trap for essentially the entire war. 

And Lemur and a few columbians had fun there for a while.

But eventually, people realized that the defenses were definitely not enough to stop Mir. Most went back to hallow vault.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">That period of Apoland is sometimes seen as a sort of golden age, as Apoland was brought into the modern era.

Lemur expanded the farms and made them bottable. Apoland even made its own XP and enchanted tools for a while.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">When people left Apoland, Lemur decided it was high time that Columbia was liberated.

He masterminded the retaking of sempiternal, using Apoland's close proximity to it to his advantage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">He and shade made a series of ice roads and then an attack tunnel to the vault all from Apoland. 

The military operation was a success at first, but NATO didn't bother to send any reinforcements and the vault was retaken.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Mir followed the tunnel back to Apoland and broke the bunker. 

Lemur was devastated and retreated to Hallow with his tail between his legs. 

His hatred for Hallow boiled over and eventually he succeeded in winning the chancellory</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">and pulled the country out of the alliance, making peace with mir.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Through the period between NATO and columbia's re-entry into the war, Apoland was on the back-burner because lemur was now leader of the whole country.

Lemur did build the skybunker "jungle gym" in that time though.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">When it became clear that a civil war was brewing in columbia, Lemur decided to quit the server, as it was affecting his mental health.

He built a mausoleum for himself right off the town square and logged off for 6 months.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The rhodesian traitors didn't step foot in Apoland, but when NATO decided they would try to get revenge on columbia for leaving, they drove the shittiest skybridge ever right over town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The Natoid obbybombers also attempted to loot the tomb of Lemur, finding nothing. 

The natoids had to pass through apoland to use its east-west iceroad to attack valyria though. This is theorized to be the reason we weren't obbybombed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The natoids were finally destroyed summer of 2020 and lemur returned to Apoland once again.

This time he gave Apoland the attention it deserved. He started a new, functional, trench. Sirboss made several great builds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">And reorganized the territory of Apoland into the Kingdom of Apoland.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 25</a><div class="page-content">The Exhibit

The room is made to look like a NATO attack tunnel, of which many were driven underneath the city.

The floor has snitches visible. Apoland has at least 4 layers of snitches in it. Old Columbia, Mir,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 25</a><div class="page-content">NATO, and the new Columbia one. One of these snitches is a real NATO snitch!

Section of the old trench. 

G-monument, one of the last things built with KnotNSA before Apoland was evacuated.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 25</a><div class="page-content">replica of entrance to emergency logout bunker. Real thing would have many more trapdoors and obviously be big enough to hold a player. 

They didn't have an easy way out, no.</div></div>
