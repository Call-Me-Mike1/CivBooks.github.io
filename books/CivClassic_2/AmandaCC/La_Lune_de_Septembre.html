<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Olympics: an event that brings nations together to face off in various sports and games, such as chess, archery, CivTCG and more! The last Olympics, held in Mount Augusta, took place in August of 2019, well</div></div>

Mount September is a relatively new city by Civ standards, and to host the Fifth Olympics here, additional infrastructure will need to be constructed, such as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">stadiums. Despite these factors, the people of Mount September are excited and very much in favor of hosting the next Olympics, so much so that it has become a factor in the upcoming Mayoral Elections. RedDevel of the GOP has stated
"I am not opposed to organizing an Olympics</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">if that is what the people desire" but also said that there should be other things he should focus on.
An anonymous source stated that the Fifth Olympics may be held in Icenia instead of MtS. Icenian President ChrisChrispie has said that Icenia “might do it” and that “work is</div></div>

ChrisChrispie wants to renovate the stadium that hosted the Icenian War Games into a large plaza capable of “hosting a parade of nations”.</div></div>

Regardless, the light of a young democracy being extinguished is always a sad thing. It seems most nations in Civ Classic are simple authoritarian governments, with no respect for the common people; hopefully this can change in the future.</div></div>
