<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">These survivors of Fire and Death eventually evolved into the first man and other animals. The original pigeons of the old world became extinct and their deaths brought great sadness to the world. Until man found and egg and hatched the first pigeon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The man who hatched the pigeon gave his nation great wealth and joy. Until the pigeon had passed. The nation went in sharp decline. Seeing this the scholars of the nation started to collect eggs in hopes of finding a pigeon pair to keep the nation wealthy forver.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The nation's rival had found a pigeon pair and had grown so much wealthy it had taken over their rivial. This nation continued to have pigeons until they had taken over the world. Sadly the pigeons they had at the time were so inbred they could not produce anymore.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The world nation had broken into many kingdoms. Every scholar from each country went looking for pigeons. And everytime a nation selfishly held on to the pigeons they end up broken into many nations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The Great Pigeon came to the world and made the pigeons more populous than ever in hopes man will be happy and change for the better. But through man's inflexibility, the pigeons had no pigeon house to live in. So they adapted to live in the nook and crannies</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">of cities. Eventually a king had converted their country to Pigeonism. And their nation peoples became the selfless heros to their allies and the most adaptable foe on the battle field. Even though this nation was extremely powerful their leaders would not conquer other peoples.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The only invasion this king would endorse would be on the 12th of every month. Only to give other nations pigeons to increase their wealth and joy amoung their populations. This king became the first member of the Columbidaes, the most righteous order of the pigeons.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The Great Pigeon decended once more and had this king to be the father of all nations. This king went nation to nation putting shrines in the nooks and crannies of cities and infrastructure. In hopes people would become as adaptable as the pigeons.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Following the death of the king his spirit was infused with every shrine in the world. The Great Pigeon made him into The Great Messanger. 

Now it is time for us acolytes to spread the joy of The Great Pigeon. And teach people on how to be flexible.</div></div>
