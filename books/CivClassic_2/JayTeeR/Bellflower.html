<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She told me stories while mending the linen with her long, crooked, nimble fingers; behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired her sight,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As far as I can remember from the things which she told me and by which my childish heart was moved, she had the large heart of a poor woman. She told me</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">told me in the evening, had none of the flavor, none of the fullness or of the vigor of the peasant woman's narratives.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Well, one Thursday when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>On opening the door of the linen room I saw the old seamstress lying on the floor by</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">spectacles glistened by the wall, where they had rolled away from her.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I cannot describe the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing room and hid myself in a dark corner in the depths of a great old armchair, where I knelt and wept. I remained there for a long time, no doubt, for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">night came on.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the cause</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">of the accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind until I die. I think that I can give the exact words which he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">used.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Ah!" he said. "The poor woman! she broke her leg the day of my arrival here.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"A young assistant teacher had just come to live in the village; he was good looking and had the bearing of a soldier. All the girls ran after him, but he was disdainful. Besides that, he was very much afraid of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">his superior, the schoolmaster, old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she left the Grabus', she went upstairs and hid among the hay to wait for her lover. He soon joined her, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 42</a><div class="page-content">he was beginning to say pretty things to her, when the door of the hayloft opened and the schoolmaster appeared and asked: 'What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?' Feeling sure that he would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 42</a><div class="page-content">replied stupidly: 'I came up here to rest a little among the bundles of hay, Monsieur Grabu.'<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"The loft was very large and absolutely dark. Sigisbert pushed the frightened girl to the farther end and said: 'Go, there and hide yourself. I shall</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"When the schoolmaster heard the whispering he continued: 'Why, you are not by yourself.'<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"'Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"'I will soon find out,' the old man replied and, double-locking the door, he went down to get a light.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Then the young man,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">who was a coward such as one sometimes meets, lost his head, and he repeated, having grown furious all of a sudden: 'Hide yourself, so that he may not find you.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense ran to the window which looked out onto the street, opened it quickly and then in a low and determined voice said: 'You will come and pick me up when he is gone,' and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">she jumped out.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Old Grabu found nobody and went down again in great surprise! A quarter of an hour later Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall, unable to get up, as</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">complain and merely said with admirable resignation: 'I am punished, well punished!'<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I sent for assistance and for the workgirl's friends and told them a made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and lamed her</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"That is all! Now I say that this woman was a heroine and had the fiber of those who accomplish the grandest deeds in</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman!
