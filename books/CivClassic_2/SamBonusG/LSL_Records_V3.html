Subjects 070-075 are to be inserted into habitat 3C. Subjects 070-072 are to be spawned from fox eggs, while subjects 073-075 are to be spawned from ocelot eggs. Both are known as passive species, and so no danger is expected to occur. Habitat has been</div></div>

Subjects #070-#072

All subjects successfully inserted into the habitat. Creatures began running around upon spawning, but in a seemingly playful manner rather than a</div></div>

All subjects successfully inserted into habitat. The</div></div>

Thirteenth installment:
Subject 076 to be inserted into havitat 3B. Subject is to be spawned from a ghast egg. Attempts to keep this type of creature alive have failed in the past, this will be the final test to see if they can be successfully held in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">captivity. Due to the massive size of the subject, the habitat has a completely flat floor made of magma and netherrack, to help the subject avoid hurting itself within the habitat.

Subject #076

Subject 076 inserted into the habitat.</div></div>

Part of the floor of the habitat was blown away by the fireballs, but the handler made it out safely. Subject is as tall as the habitat, and it seems like it is having difficulty moving.</div></div>

Subjects #077-#078

Subjects 077 and 078 are both identical in size in behavior. Both subjects began to chase the handler as</div></div>

Handlers had no choice but to put the slime down. Larger than subjects 077 and 078, the lumbering slime was slain, which was followed by it dividing into four smaller slimes. Each those slimes were slain as well, and each killing was met with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">spawn of four more smaller blobs. Eventually, all blobs were extinguished permanently. What should have been a single mercy killing wound up being 16 frenzied slaughters.

Subject twice the size of it's roommates, and almost overwhelmed the handler before he could escape. Handler did get through the exit.

Subjects 081-084 to be inserted into habitat 3A. Subjects are to be spawned from mooshroom eggs. Habitat has been set up with mycelium and two tall mushrooms, as well as small pone. Mooshrooms are known to be extremely passive, so risk and danger is at a minimum</div></div>
