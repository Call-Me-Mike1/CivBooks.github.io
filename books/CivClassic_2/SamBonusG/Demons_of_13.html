<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Trapped in a cage to your right you will see the zoglin named Leviathan, most likely bathing in his little pool of lava. Leviathan must be caged due to some violent urges against the magma cubes that he can't seem to control.

The magma cubes can be seen bouncing around the Hell, sometimes on to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">your little saftey bubble or on to Leviathan's cage. The two larger magma cubes go by Incubus and Succubus, while their much smaller sibling goes by Gello. Gello does not seem to be aware that he is much smaller than most of the other demons in the Hell.

Then there are the blazes, filled with anger</div></div>

Their names are Alastor, Demogorgon, and Dusios, and while they may get along with their current demon roommates, they are not to be messed around with by anything outside of the Hell.</div></div>

Mammon and Nephilim can be seen to your left, while Tartaruchi is usually found in a lava pool on the far side of the</div></div>

Hell once had two ghasts living within it, both now deceased. Their names were Lucifer and Baphomet. It's a shame they couldn't survive in the Hell, as the entire purpose of the</div></div>

spacious place for them to live. There are some that say ghasts do have an afterlife though. Sometimes in the dead of night, you can hear the shrieks of Lucifer and Baphomet from deep within the netherrack in the Hell.
