        Volume 1</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">First installment:
Subjects 001-006 will be spawned in habitat 1D, one at a time. Subjects 001-004 will be spawned from spider eggs, while subjects 005 and 006 will be spawned from cave spider eggs. Subjects will be inserted into the habitat one at a time. Hostility is expected.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #001:

Subject 001 inserted into habitat. Initially hostile as expected, but later began to look ill and retreated to a corner of the habitat, where it remains.

Subject #002:

Subject 002 inserted into habitat on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">opposite side. Hostility ensued upon the spawn, but the
subject seems to be a normal, healthy spider despite its aggression.

Subject #003:

Subject 003 inserted into habitat while trying to avoid Subject 2. Confusion upon spawning, as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subject 003 has turned out to be a spider with the power of invisibility. Subject is completely transparent except for the reds of its eyes. Behavior is erratic, darting around the habitat and doing a lot of spinning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #004

Subject 004 inserted into habitat. After initial aggression, found an interest in the tree. Made several attempts to reach the top of the tree before finally making it and settling there to rest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #005:

Subject 005 inserted into habitat, initially thought to have immediatley died due to a disappearance after poisoning the handler. However, subject has been found huddling with subject 003 in a corner.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #006

Subject 006 inserted into habitat, and immediately poisoned its handler. The handler died while opening the door to leave the habitat, causing subject 006 to temporarily escape. Handler had subject chase him back into the habitat, where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subject was safely secured. Subject seems to enjoy cuddling, as it curled right up to its regular spider cousins.


Second installment:
Subjects 007-010 will be inserted into habitat 1C one at a time. They will all be spawned from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">creeper eggs. The explosive nature of these subjects has been noted, and the handlers have been told to handle the spawns with caution, and to stay far away from the subjects once spawned.

Subject #007:

Subject 007 inserted</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">into habitat, followed by immediate explosion. Handler could not get nametag on while also getting far enough away in time. Subject 007 is now deceased.

Subject #008:

Subject 008 inserted into habitat without a nametag at first, so handler had time to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">get away. However, upon returning to the habitat to place the nametag, the subject exploded before the handler could run away after naming it. Subject 008 is now deceased.

Subject #009:

Wall of dirt has been set up to spawn</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subject 009 in so that the subject cannot chase the handlers after being named. This method finally proved successful with this subject. Subject currently detained to one corner of the habitat, will remain there until after subject 010 has been spawned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #010

Same method using the wall of dirt to detain this subject while it gets named. Subject successfully spawned and named without harm or explosion. The dirt walls were removed through holes in the glass so as to free subjects 009 and 010 from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">confinements so that they may roam around the habitat. Both subjects show no sign of holding a soul, almost robotic.


Third installment:
Subjects 011-014 shall be spawned within habitat 1B, one at a time. Subjects will be spawned using</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">vindicator eggs. Due to knowledge of vindicators' high awareness, only subject 011 will be spawned and named from within the habitat. Subjects 012-014 shall be spawned and named through holes in the glass wall to prevent handlers from being slaughtered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #011

Subject 011 inserted into habitat, handler was immediately slaughtered after attaching the nametag to the subject. Upon sending another handler into the habitat to retrieve the dropped nametags, the subject took chase to the handler as soon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">as it noticed he was there. Handler just managed to escape in time with the nametags before slamming the door in the subject's face.

Subject #012

Subject 012 inserted into habitat through hole in the glass. Handler was able to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">easily name the subject as it desperately tried to fit itself through the hole in the glass, to no avail. Similar to subject 011, pure aggression is shown.

Subjects #013 & #014

Subjects 013 and 014 both inserted into habitat the same way</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">as subject 012. Successful spawning of all four subjects has been achieved. All subjects show an equivalent amount of excessive aggression. Subject 011 remains by the door, as it is the only subject that has seen where victims can come from and escape to.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">sidenote:
Subjects 001, 003, 004, 005, and 006 have all begun to haddle in one corner of their habitat. Subject 002 resides in its own corner. The conglomeration of spiders makes it difficult to tell them apart from one another.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Fourth installment:
Subjects 015-019 are to be inserted into habitat 1E, one at a time. Subjects 015 and 016 will be spawning from endermen eggs, while subjects 016-019 will be spawning from endermite eggs. No definite assurance whether the endermen will be kind or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">aggressive, but the endermites are known to be aggressive. Endermen will be inserted first to determine the behavior of the subjects.

Subject #015

Subject 015 was inserted into habitat. Subject shows no sign</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of aggression, seems to be trying to say something to the handler.

Subject #016

Subject 016 inserted into habitat. Very docile nature, seems harmless. Does not seem to be interacting with subject 015 as much as expected, as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">both subjects have wandered towards opposite sides of the habitat.

Subject #017

Subject inserted into habitat. Subject is incredibly small, but immediatley showed hostility towards handler and gave chase as he exited</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the door. Subject was too slow to cause any damage to the handler.

Subject #018

Subject 018 inserted into habitat and immediatley gave chase just like subject 017. After handler had gotten out of the habitat,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subject began to vibrate incredibly fast while spinning around for about three seconds, before going about it's business.

Subject #019

Subject inserted into habitat. As handler was naming subject, subjects 017 and 018 began to attack him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Handler was able to outrun the subjects enough to be able to escape while keeping subjects in the habitat. Subject 019 went to the top of the endstone sculpture directly after the chase of the handler.


Fifth installment:
Subjects 020-025 will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">be inserted into habitat 1A. All subjects will be spawned from zombie piglin eggs. Level of hostility from subjects is unknown, handlers told to approach the spawns with caution in case the subjects decide to perform an immediate attack.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #020:

Subject 020 inserted into habitat, proved to be extremely docile. In fact, I am writing this in the habitat with him.
Subject took an immediate notice of the lava fountain, and began to climb to the top, seemingly unaffected by the heat of the lava.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subjects #021-#025

Rest of the subjects all inserted into habitat with the same ease and success as subject 020. Subjects seem to be very friendly, and will often run right up to the handler and harmlessly push him around. Piglins prove to be great creatures</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">even when they are in zombie form. After the handler left the habitat, subjects 022 and 024 hopped directly into the lava fountain and began to use it as a show. Lava has no effect on the subjects, in fact they seem to enjoy being bathed in it.
The following day, the handler went in to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">habitat to test the behavior of the subjects. Subject 022 was given a light punch by the handler, and responded with immediate rage and took chase to the handler. The handler was able to escape the habitat, but it was found that the subject had enough power to cause</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">damage through the glass walls if you were to stand close enough.


Sixth installment:
Subjects 026-031 shall be inserted into habitat 2C. Subjects are to be spawned using witch eggs. Approach to the installment will be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">similar to the one taken with subjects 011-014, as witches have been known to be immediately aggressive just like vindicators. Subject 026 to be inserted and named from within the cage. Insertion method for the following subjects will depend on the behavior of subject</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">026.

Subject #026

Subject inserted directly into habitat by handler. Hostility was not apparent at first, as subject's first reaction was to slowly back away from the handler. Things began to turn violent however, as the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subject began throwing potions of a volatile nature at the handler. The handler managed to escape the habitat, but the poison in his system brought him extremely close to death before he was able to fully recover.

Subject #027</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject was inserted through a hole in the glass wall to help the handler avoid being attacked by subject 026. However, handler stayed next to the hole too long after spawning subject 027, resulting in the handler being poisoned by the subject and nearly dying from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">toxicity again. Potions used by these witches seem to only affect the victim until they are on the verge of death, essentially allowing them to cause the most damage without being entirely fatal.

Subjects #028-#031

Remaining subjects all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">inserted into habitat successfully without incident. This was made possible after the discovery of the massive ego of all of the subjects. Because of this, the subjects will always keep their heads held high, creating a blind spot for them for anything below eye level. By simply creating a hole</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in the glass wall below eye level, handlers were able to insert the rest of the subjects into the habitat without any of the subjects even noticing. All subjects show same deranged behavior, considered highly dangerous.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Additional spawn to habitat 1E:

Subject #032 to be inserted into habitat 1E from an enderman egg. Subject will be inserted through hole in the glass to help handler avoid aggression of subjects 017-019.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Seventh installment:
Subjects 033-040 to be inserted into habitat 2D. Subjects 033-035 are to be spawned from zombie eggs, while subjects 036-040 are to be spawned from stray eggs. Subjects spawning from zombie eggs will be spawned from directly within the habitat, as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">handlers are confident they can outrun the zombie spawns with no trouble. Once strays begin to spawn, subjects will be inserted through a hole in the glass wall, as habitat will be too crowded by then for handler to be able to escape.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #033

Subject 033 inserted into habitat, and predictably began to immediatley attack the handler. Handler was able to escape after only getting bitten once by the subject.

Subject #034

Subject 034 inserted</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">into habitat with haste, as subject 033 immediatley took notice to the handler's entrance. Handler was able to spawn subject 034 and still escape, although it was a much closer call then before. Remaining subjects will be inserted though holes in the glass wall due to saftey concerns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #035

Good call on continuing spawns through the glass wall instead of directly, as subject 035 seems to have spawn weilding an enchanted shovel, making it much more dangerous than subjects 033 and 034.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Subject #036

Subject 036 inserted into habitat through hole in glass wall. Subject spawned weilding a bow and arrow, and immediatley shot at handler though hole in the wall. Subject's ability to practice archery suggests that strays are more related to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">skeletons, not zombies as previously  thought.

Subjects #037-#040

Remaining subjects all inserted into habitat without incident. All stray spawns seem to appear armed with a bow and arrows, showing that this weapon is actually an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">essential part to the identity of these subjects. Strays and zombies do not seem to mind each other's prescence, and violent altercations between the subjects has yet to occur. Hopefully it stays that way.</div></div>
