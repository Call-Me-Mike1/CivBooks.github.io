<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Brewing is a craft that has been looked at as a useless plug-in by a portion of the community. It however, is one of the fastest way to create a friend, or just really fuck up your current friends and have a good laugh. There are other uses</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The brewing plug-in was created October 26, 2013. To my knowledge the first Civ iterations to start using it was Devoted. Keeping to a 10-20 types of drinks, all mostly used as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 28</a><div class="page-content">roleplay friendly drinks. One of the sought after drinks was the well guarded Zyklon-B, hidden by the Channers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Civclassics took a swing at the plug-in as well. GreatlordOz was in charge of the project of bringing drinks to the server, along with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the help of RektTangle for brew creation. Early on we had up to around 20 drinks to start with, until the release of a full 150 drinks. Oz had used the plugin to its absolute potential to a point I don't believe any other server has done.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">After a few months of the end of the Somber War another 150 drinks were added, doubling the amount of drinks to be found. Supposedly if the server updates again, there is another large portion of drinks to be added to the server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Brewing can be a very simple task, or can be a very pain stakingly long task. Brewing first starts with a cauldron with fire underneath it, this is used to ferment drinks from 2 min-30 min, you can check with R click with clock,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">some drinks only take this stage of brewing (example being Potato Soup, recipe in back).<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Next step can go three ways from here. Distilling, Barreling, or Distilling then barreling. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Distilling<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Distilling takes a brewing stand that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">uses a glowstone dust as a filter inside the top part of the brewing stand, and doesnt go away. You do not need to worry about fueling the brewing stand with blaze powder. After fermentation put the 3 bottles in the brewing stands, it will look like</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">it is doing nothing, however give it time and something will come out. If it's indefinable distillate it tends to be a ruined drink, and its back to the drawing board, if you get something else, you can go to the Quality chapter of this book for more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">information, however leaving the drink in the distill stand it will go to full green quality distill eventually and can be pulled out at any time.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Barreling<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is the more complex part of brewing, since there are 6 barrel types</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">dependant on wood type. There are two barrel sizes, the larger one is the storage size of a single chest. The smaller barrel is 1 line of inventory space, but you can fit more smaller barrels in the same space as a large barrel. The small barrel is 2x2</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">wooden stair cases, then a sign saying "barrel" on it will create your barrel, these barrels can be connected to eachother as long as they are still in a barrel shape. Putting a drink in the barrel will start to age the drink, and could allow you to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">discover a drink. You are aging the drinks so it takes a while for this process, 1 year = 20 mins irl. The longest amount of time a drink can take is 25 years which is equal to 8.3 hours, but not a lot are like this. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">longest and sometimes trickiest brewing done. After you follow the distilling, you have to figure out if the alcohol is ageable. It's very easy to forget this and never truly perfect the drink.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There have been several times where a drink was left</div></div>

If you put the drink in the distiller or the barrel you can check each part of the quality in detail, from time fermented, distilling, barrel age, and wood type (if barrel aged).<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It is graded from Dark red being worst, yellow being medium, to</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-Write down everything. Every attempt you do you should try your best to write it down (but hey sometimes we get lazy and can't be fucked). <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-Spread Sheets.</div></div>
