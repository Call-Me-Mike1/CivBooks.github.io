Solvaine Ambriel was born in the year 781 AC, to the noble sages Mandragoran and Octavia Ambriel of Acmez, defenders of Candlekeep in the mountians above the Dragons Throat (though at that time, it had not yet aquired the name).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The Naming of Dragon's Throat

When Solvaine was but ten, he and his father Mandragoran were down by the river beneath Acmez (now called Highpoint), inspecting the Watchmen of the Isles.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The Naming of Dragon's Throat cont.

At that time, a great dragon Rhyso the Tender, dove into the canyon, devouring ten men in one bite. Mandragoran fought the beast Rhyso bravely, but was felled, dropping the crystal sword, Callandor.</div></div>

Distraught at the loss of his father, the young Solvaine weilded Callandor, the crystal sword, passed from hero to hero through the ages, and felled Rhyso by plunging the sword through it's throat. Henceforth the pass has been</div></div>

Solvaine grew in strength and renound as he felled dragons vile that besieged Acmez and Candlekeep, with the help of the Watchmen of the Isles, and his trusted friend Runasev Brewer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Solvaine's Growth and the discovery of Noxzyidri cont.

One grave day, a vibrant sapphire dragon shook the base of Candlekeep, and swore it would bring destruction on Solvaine Dragon'sbane, flier of the Daybreak Banner.</div></div>

Once she returned to her hoard, Solvaine and Runasev planned that night. The two snuck out of Hummingbird Perch Brewery in the night, scaling down the cliffs with Runasev's wolfhound, Icarius, whom he had recieved from the master of</div></div>

Pupper's Inn. Solvaine and Runasev knew they must sneak in the night, for if the town knew of their dangerous quest, the pair would have been ripped limb from limb to stop them from leaving. At the base of the cliffs, they went</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Within the Stone

Solvaine and Runasev used their strength, courage, and wit to navigate the devious traps laid out by the Dragon Noxzyidri, letting the Daybreak Banner guide their path through the darkness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Within the Stone cont.

Finally, once passing the trials, Solvaine, Runasev, and loyal Icarius prepared to face the dragon. Solvaine held Callandor and the Daybreak Banner aloft. Runasev consumed a brew of vision. Icarius arched his back.</div></div>

Runasev, now blind, returned to Acmez being guided by the wolfhound Icarius. Though pained by the loss of his friend, he became the greatest brewmaster south of the Nexus, and the Hummingbird Perch flourished.</div></div>

Upon the death of his trusty wolfhound, Runasev buried the dog and the Daybreak Banner at the highest point above Pupper's Inn, so the two could watch over the town for all time.</div></div>

As I have reviewed this ancient text, I have noticed a number of pages missing. The curiosity missing in Solvaine's confrontation has caused me to search for what could have occurred. My search has led me to 2 ends.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Candlekeep Avowed Note cont.

1) It is said that Runasev himself may have removed the pages missing from the tales. It then could be likely for the pages to be stored in a place he has visited before.</div></div>

2) Attached to an old copy of this text is the follow words:

"Courage to strengthen, a diamond to shine; iron to learn, seek high and you'll find."

As for what this could</div></div>
