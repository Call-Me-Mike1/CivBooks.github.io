<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     The city of Orion has proved time and time again to be Imperialist war hawks. Orion, and it's heavily armed police force have opressed the international proletariat more</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     I would like to revisit the Bohr Wars now. If you are unaware, the Bohr</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Wars were short armed conflicts in between the People's Republic of Freyr and Bohr Islans. The Conflict ended after a truce was signed that split Bohr Island into two, with South Bohr Island becoming a territory of Freyr and North Bohr remaining indepen-</div></div>

This truce would be broken when Ogel16000 counter-attacked and was quickly pearled. As the PRF was working the details out, the Imperialist army known as the Orion police department quickly saw this as a chance to attack South Bohr.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">     The Orion Police Department, or the OPD, treated the entire island as a war tarfet and fired on civilians and bombed homes. It is estimated that 10-20 thousand innocents were killed. The OPD has not acknowledged its crimes in the Bohr Wars.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The Imperialism does not end there, however. You may remember Clocktown, a small town that was founded in Orion Borders. The town was small and peaceful, yet Orion saw this as a threat. A threat to their hegemony. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     Orion was swift, and within a</div></div>

This was a clear message that anyone attempting to challenge Orion's Global Hegemony would be crushed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Furthermore, recent leaks from CivInfoWars have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">shown that Orion has been funding terrorists that target New Leningrad. The report detailed arms and lava buckets that were left in drop chests for the Gerfer Terrorists to use against New Leningrad.      <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     It is also believed that the terrorist</div></div>

It is also a well known fact that Orion funds the IRA, or Irish Republican Army. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     It's no wonder why Orion is so anti-Communist, Communism challenges their free markets</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>     With all the points I brought up today, it is very safe to say that Orion IS an Imperialist city and a major Capitalist oppressor. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
