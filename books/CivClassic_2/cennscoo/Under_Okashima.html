<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Can you smell the salt on the air? The approaching aura of the briny sea? I've never smelt it before, but I knew it the very moment that I did. I wonder if you would, Isaac? You were more serious, ponderous by far from my flight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  I was young when I first learned of our heritage in that far off city of Okashima. A foreign place, such to make our senses sing with the mediocrity of our birth home.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Seventeen years ago, that. And now the sea breeze blows by fresh and fast.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>now. I can see it upon the horizon, with those walls of white, spoken to be something like gentle. The sway of a curtain, swathed round the life and light that each contains. Ghosts, swaying in the evening sky.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  My cart pulls slowly into the station at the south side of the city which awaits me. The air stands thick with moisture, a smothering blanket embracing me in its welcome.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A cursory survey reveals the presence of no others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  It isn't right. I had been told to meet a person, in the letter you and I recieved mere nights ago.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Perhaps you hold it near now?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Regardless, no one awaits me in or around the station, but it is known that adventure needn't permission.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  So into the city I tread, even as a red dusk settles upon it. The hazy cast settles agreeably over the wraithlike silhouettes of the buildings round me. Not one opens. No face in a window. No creak in a door.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A castle stands proud beyond the rail.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 45</a><div class="page-content">   It too proves a source of no answers and no aid. The iron door reflects the only face I've yet seen here.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  An archway draped in crimson flags waits and beckons near, however, bathed deeper shades in the sunset. The greater town beyond it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  I walk beneath that humble archway, and still no eyes meet me save those that urge a shrill uncertainty up my spine.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  We are surely the sons of ghosts if we come from here, Isaac. I wander this main street, greeted only by the austerity of the quiet.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A building awaits, but with no door on this side. It hunches, turns its back to the street</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 45</a><div class="page-content">as though to offer a cold shoulder to all those unfamiliar.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Not to be so easily turned, I stride about it, seeking egress. Night is soon and the world is full of dangers that walk in murky places.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I find no door. Some oversight of building?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  When I come back around to the main road, however, I see it. You'd laugh, Isaac, and clap the back of my head for the boyish idiocy. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  There is a door, naturally, but it stands against a knock and a testing of the knob. No sanctuary here.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 45</a><div class="page-content"> The world starts to grow dimmer, with only torches making their faint offerings of light. Torches. Chicken feathers! Torches.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The torches must be tended, and so people there must be, yes?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I call out softly into the dim, and squint to its shades.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  Nothing answers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  But there are stalls ahead, their curtains damp with sea air and swaying around innards that lack all the inviting glow of the buildings around.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Yet something moves among them, a brief trick of the eyes amid the curtains' sway.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  No, not a trick of the eyes. The movement brings my sight to a canal lining one of the major paths, scarcely noticed in the dusk and uncertainty. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The figure is gone, last glimpsed crossing a bridge. I lurch into motion, calling out again, hopeful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  It may yet be my promised tour guide, is my thought as I cross that rickety canal bridge. It's darker still on this side of the waters, and with the ascending night.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Market stalls stand vacant here, as they did on the other side before ghosts winked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  Surely there must be an inn somewhere here for the weary, but as I wander the quiet of this new district, I find none.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Salt catches in my nose again, the breath of the sea close at hand. And I turn to see that blue horizon, all-consuming.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  My steps grow less fidgety, less hastened as I gaze out for the first time at the sea. Our ancestors once were here, in this strange and quiet place.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  My foot comes upon nothingness then, and the rest of me soon follows.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 45</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4: Hush<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The first sensation is cold, rushing up and over and all around, swallowing me into a pitiless embrace so unlike the faint warmth in the breeze. My mouth opens in a gasp as I flail to right myself, but I draw in water as much as air.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  Spluttering after the initial shock, I paddle in dark waters. When I blink away the daze from my eyes, I can see stars still overhead. When my hand flails a certain way, it comes against rough stonework.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I orient to see the top of this hole, close.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  And yet out of reach.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  My breathing quickens much as it may. Already I am washed cold from the water. Confused, as to the hole in the city streets. Frightened, for I'd not before realized my unease in the dark.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  I wish you were with me, brother. You would have learned this when you first heard Okashima stood by the sea, and would have outpaced those chancing to be born here.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  But I meekly paddle with escape so close and so far. Tears sting my eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  Again I call, but there is no answer.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I hear a faint splashing, elsewhere. When I turn my head, vision clearer now than when I first fell, I notice the hole to be more - a tunnel beneath the city. A structure then.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Which means an exit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  Chapter 5: Exit<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  We've ancestry in Okashima. I clung to that thought as I slowly, carefully paddled my way through the tunnel. In utter darkness. A swallowing oblivion.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  It might be poetic to die here, but I am no poet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  The water clings heavy on my clothes. They grasp at me, my very human modesty seeking to betray me. But I won't shuck them off yet. I may still find help, or an exit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I'm chilled, though, all the way down to my most private places. An invading cold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  The water seems only to become more sluggish, almost as mud. I can barely tread it now, pressing through with heavy feet and tired arms.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  A faint sheen of light glows ahead. Another opening, surely this one an intended one.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The light fades.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Consider that, Isaac. I stumble, in this underground river of mud and water. But then it isn't mud and water. There is only bleak, black emptiness, and a sort of dread I can't fully describe takes up residence within my chest, coiled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 45</a><div class="page-content">  I stand there a moment in startlement. And dread. Dread that I've realized there was a fork prior, and I'm not sure which way I went. Dread that I'm curious of what's ahead, if there is some exit to be found in this place.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Dread of the watched.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I know what you think, brother. You see the ragged edges between this page and the last, betraying something that once was there.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I only wish I could remember what it was. Where was I? Treading water in dark.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Isaac, you would remember the way if you came here. Your memory was always so very clever.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  I place my hand to the stone side again, and feel almost as though I cry quiet tears of relief.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
