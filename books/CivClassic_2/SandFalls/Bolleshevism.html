Published by The Workers' Party</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">  Comrade ZombieLenin: Hero of the People, Founder of the Party, Liberator of Workers, etc. His titles, as his deeds, are as endless as his wisdom. Single- handedly building the Party and its ideology.
  Without ZombieLenin, there would be no Party. Without him, the workers of Civ would have no hope.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">But! He was here. He is here, even still. Even despite his extended rest to rebuild and maintain his undead form, the Dear Leader still walks with us in our words and deeds.
  This was mostly directly seen in his successor, Comrade Chairman BolleDeBoll. It was under the wise and watchfull eye</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">of Comrade Bolle that the Party would grow to head a true super power in CivCraft 2.0, the Federal Socialist Republic. It was under his eye that the Party survived the collapse of CivCraft and moved to CivClassics. Truly, Comrade Bolle stands alongside ZombieLenin. The Founder and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Chairman. The two giants.
  But, Comrade Bolle has been summoned to rest alongside our Comrade ZombieLenin, and thus we are left without his guidance. What can we learn from the leadership of the Chairman? What is to be done in the absence of these giants?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">  Without their wisdom, our duty is to learn. To continue the Party as it was founded and cultivated by these giants, we must see how they did it. It is no longer enough to know only ZombieLeninism. We need to go to the next stage. We need Bolleshevism.</div></div>

-------------------
  In the absence of their wisdom, we cannot rely on a single leader. Instead, we must spread the duties of Party leader to a larger degree of the Party. There must still be a leader, but they can no longer rule alone.
  The leader decides</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">which aspects of rule they give to trusted comrades, but to put all responsibility into one person is no longer feasible in the absense of the Dear Leaders. This circle of trusted comrades can stretch from a Central Committee to the entire apparatus of the Party. This development is seen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">in utero in the era of Comrade BolleDeBoll. While a very wise and capable leader, Dear Leader BolleDeBoll would always ask others in his Central Committee on their thoughts on certain routes of action. Of course, he was always correct in his original choice, but he wished to include the rest in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">this process.
  But now, none of us can compare to his or Comrade ZombieLenin's wisdom, and so this way of involving other Party members is now a necessary part of the entire decision- making process.
  In the era of First Secretary SandFalls, this theory of ZL-B was put into practice</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">for the first time.
  In my leadership of the Confederation of Socialist Augusta, I have implemented a rather decentralized system of governing, while keeping sole Premiership of the CSA and leadership of The Workers' Party. In this way, I am able to steer the ship of the State and Party, while</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">ensuring any sort of distraction is still able to be corrected by other comrades. It is in this way that the great task of steering the Party can be done without the Great Leaders themselves. In this era without their guidance, we must cast aside ego and aspirations for power. The Party is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">in a new world.
  There are none else like the Dear Leaders, Comrades ZombieLenin and BolleDeBoll. And there never will be again. There is no more room for the individual leadership of the Golden Ages. We must put our faith in the Party as a whole, and in the legacies of the Dear Leaders.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">  Only then may we steer this ship even half as well as them. Only then may we be worthy of their legacy - The Workers' Party.

Long Live ZombieLenin!
Long Live BolleDeBoll!
Long Live the Party!</div></div>
