<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I've had my tour of the city, and am back in my boat.  It is a rainy night, and the chill saturates my body. I feel at once miserable and electric. I will continue north, perhaps stopping by near Mount Augusta.</div></div>

Thankfully, it was a quick rail ride back to my death where I retrieved my items and continued along the path.  There I found something of a shantytown run by communists.
