<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Who am I? My name is Cammo, I was a citizen with Veritas for the tail end of Veritas.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I saw the horrors of war up close. The horrible end to Ruin was witnessed by me first hand, here I am going to tell you a story. A story of the history between Ruin and Veritas, and the ultimate downfall of one of the more popular nations on the server,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">because of stupid decisions, and cockiness.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So, who was I on Devoted? I was Fapping_Cammo, I joined in late February, and instantly joined Veritas, because of my good friend Coni. There I met some amazing people,</div></div>

We're here to talk about the war that transpired three months after I joined. So after I was with Veritas for a month, I finally met the infamous Dollaz, you all might know him now for his</div></div>

He was the leader of Ruin, along with I believe Elab and Gobblin. I started hanging out with these guys after I dug out their vault hole, and had an amazing time. Eventually, I became a</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But eventually in late</div></div>

I think by this time, Volterra had attacked Ruin and was griefed, but I'm not too sure. By this point, I was still with Veritas, and wasn't planning to leave.

<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">involved in discussions about a war starting, but I was in no position to enter something like that, so I kept my distance from the prospect of joining the war.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One day, when I was talking to Dollaz, that's when I say</div></div>

Eventually, when I needed my prot repaired, he put the repair price at 8 stacks of obby, which was not a fair price, considering I thought we were good friends, so I said no.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I lost my citizenship, and I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">left the Discord, because of how I felt like I was being used.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Two weeks later, that's when Ruin attacked. Ruin went to Volterra and attacked their vault. While this was happening, we had Veritas citizens preparing for the blowback,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Considering we were considered allies to everyone else to Ruin, we felt that we were going to be attacked, so Coni announced that we weren't with Ruin, and that they were their own group, and we aren't involved.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">After a couple of days of Ruin attacking Volterra, and Volterra reacting by attacking back, Veritas was still ready for anything.

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">recording of the fight, which eventually ended with three Ruin members getting pearled, and none of us being pearled, which was an incredible feat.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A couple of days later, as I sat in bed, on the server, bored out of my mind</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After Ruin was infiltrated, we found out that everyone that was in Ruin at the time was pearled. Which was unfortunate,</div></div>

That was it basically, unfortunately Ruin was left in ruins, and Dollaz turned on everyone, and became a big dog.</div></div>
