Then there came a young god by the name ttk2, who dreamed a dream of a new world of peace and war, of suffering and success, of victory and defeat without his deathgrip.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 47</a><div class="page-content">He named this world Civcraft, and invited many lesser gods to partake in its creation.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  These early settlements of Civcraft experienced bountiful harvests, profitable ventures and an endless supply of political turmoil. Ttk2 found adoration among the Anarco-Capitalists, who rejected all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 47</a><div class="page-content">notions of power above their individuality. These AnCaps became so powerful in the light of ttk2 they battled for dominance, and won, across the world. Rejecting individualism, the LSIF believed their collusion would lead to ultimate strength.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Without a sword being raised, the AnCaps defeated the LSIF at their home, Columbia. This victory, however, came at a cost. Standing unchallenged, a radical sect of AnCaps began a campaign of destruction against those who spoke out</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">against them. In their anger, they rejected ttk2 and ransacked his earthly home The Rift. Ttk2, disappointed in his errant children but determined to stick by his principles, ascended to permanent god status, never to return.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 47</a><div class="page-content">  Despite the outbreak in violence, Civcraft continued to grow. Among the many cities who populated the world, the great city of Mount Augusta sprang up as a metropolis. The city, although rooted in Anarcho-Capitalism, maintained a Minarchist balance</div></div>

Within these city streets, a young lost soul by the name of Shadedjon wandered. His heart filled with teenage rage, he shook all notion of propriety and lived as a common bandit among the sheep. His name was feared far and wide, his sword</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Trouble swiftly came to the land. The success of Civcraft attracted more than just the untethered souls who populated the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Ravenous, violent beyond sense, filled with hormonal anger the HCF Invaders descended upon Civcraft like a thousand screeching hornets. The HCF Invasion devastated the world. The great cities, including Mount Augusta, were laid to waste.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Many souls were captured, never to return, and those few who survived hid out in the wilderness to avoid being captured or killed by the invaders. These demons raped the once thriving world of Civcraft and reduced it to a shadow of its former self.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 47</a><div class="page-content">But the strongest, most resilient souls persisted and in that persistence appealed to their god, ttk2. AnCap and LSIF alike cried out for help, and their calls were answered. The shackles that bound their brethren to the invaders were loosed.</div></div>

The stories of friendship and love, betrayal and pain, the conflicts grand and minute all vanished in the blink of an eye. And so the world was ended, ttk2 destroying that which he created in the name of those who lived it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 47</a><div class="page-content">  Out of this inferno came a new beginning. Ttk2, heeding the calls by his souls, created a new world for them. Like birds finding their nest, the vast souls returned, and became Civcrafters: and their home, Civcraft Two Point O.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 47</a><div class="page-content">After watching his home be violated, then violently destroyed, the young criminal Shadedjon vowed to reform his ways. He stepped gingerly back into the light of the new world, a Civcrafter, and entered into the rebirth of Mount Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 47</a><div class="page-content">As the city was reborn, so too was Shadedjon. Little did he, nor those around him know, but in his chest, beat the heart of a god.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Reborn into the fire of the new world, the young mortal Civcrafter Shadedjon wandered the world of Civcraft from town to town. He mastered the art of identity</div></div>

Ever a worldly man, he became close to the AnCaps of Carson who traded the secrets of AnCap worship, and for a time Shadedjon was a devout ttk2 worshiper.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">But time came, and he sought to be a different man.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  At a time of crisis, he returned to the city of his youth. Elected to lead Mount Augusta, he met the young Civcrafter ProgrammerDan. In ProgrammerDan he saw great future and promise.</div></div>

Their power was greatly waned, however, and a league of guardians rose to meet them time and time again.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In those days, Shadedjon journeyed to another world, known as CivEx. The gods of CivEx were a jealous lot, guarding their precious souls defensively and ruling with an</div></div>

Shadedjon saw that this was ill, that the many souls who resided on CivEx were in fact prisoners of their gods. The gods there saw no wrong with living among their adherents, mingling with the souls for both good and bad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 47</a><div class="page-content">If their souls dare speak against them, they were struck down.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Shadedjon and a legendary band of companions arrived</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 47</a><div class="page-content">to liberate the souls trapped by the CivEx gods.

<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 47</a><div class="page-content">to impose a soul-led rule free of the shackles from their gods.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  This infuriated the gods. They conferred with darker, more vile forms of their</div></div>
