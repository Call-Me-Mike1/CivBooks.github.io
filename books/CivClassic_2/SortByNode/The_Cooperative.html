<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Two days later, hunger started to take wear down. To top off my terrible misfortune, my path had taken me to the top of a snow-capped mountain, and I could feel my fingers and toes starting to nip</div></div>

I knew the valley was close though, so even with the possibilty of my death drawing nearer I kept walking. My desire to see my companions and find ourselves a place to call a home drove me foward.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Blinking away the ice crystals that had</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 48</a><div class="page-content">increasing with every step. I can't remember how long I walked until I reached the valley, but I clearly remember the food being shoved into my hand by TheShockinatorV2, with Whoabear97 standing nearby. It was then that I slipped out of my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 48</a><div class="page-content">near-death haze, and looked around at the place we had found ourselves. It was a beautiful little valley.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Night was drawing closer upon us, so we quickly dug ourselves a small hovel to shelter us for the night. We made three small bedrolls and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 48</a><div class="page-content">hunkered down for the night. That was the first time I had slept a full night in quite some time. It was peaceful, we had found ourselves a little sanctuary. A New Haven was found.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> The next morning we ate the few pieces of meat that Shock had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 48</a><div class="page-content">hunted while on the way to our meeting site, and talked about our journeys to the valley. Whoabear had lost his way in forest to the way, getting himself turned around more then he made progress. He did manage to find some game fowl to stave off hunger</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 48</a><div class="page-content">while he hid from the undead that plagued the land when darkness fell. In the north, Shock had found himself traveling along a river before heading south and wandering into the kingdom of Amani. There TheGreatUniter told Shock of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 48</a><div class="page-content">freezing mountain that lay between him and the valley, and advised him to wait and travel around the mountain rather than over. Though hesitant, Shock took the advice and stayed a night in the borders of Amani. It was then that the first bit of luck</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 48</a><div class="page-content">happened upon our group; as the next morning Whoabear also found himself standing upon Amani soil. The two of them shared an elated greeting before starting their planning for the next few days. They agreed upon going around the mountain</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">rather than over, even though they had fastened leather gear to keep them warm, as the journey would only be slightly less treacherous with their meager supplies. They found the valley the next day, the same day I was coming down the mountain, half frozen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">and starving. Spending the day cooking food, they discussed what to do if I did not show up soon, but before they could get any real decision made, I came shambling into eyesight.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> While we had been discussing our adventures, we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">surveyed the valley, the beautiful landscape grabbing our attention, hearts, and minds. A brief moment hung between the three of us before I broke the silence.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> "This could be our new home."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Two nods of agreement followed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 48</a><div class="page-content">the statement, then words of admiration for the land were shared.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> We quickly set about building a town to call our own, gathering lumber and cobblestone for materials. I set about mining, having found a natural system of caves, hoping to find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 48</a><div class="page-content">iron to better our tools. The other two being more concerned with hospitality and filling our stomachs, respectively. Shock and Whoabear set about on their own projects. Knowning that the land would yield a good harvest of crops, Whoabear started putting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 48</a><div class="page-content">together a farm, while Shock built a tavern for comfort and shelter.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> During one trip out of the mines to give some of the small amount of iron I had gathered to my companions, we heard a booming roar in the distance. Curious and concerned, we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 48</a><div class="page-content">headed up the hill in the direction we heard the sound emanate, hoping to<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>get a look at the creature that<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>caused it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Before we made it to the top, the fearsome creature reared its head over the hilltop. A large black scaled Dragon flew in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">circle over us, sending a powerful fireball crashing near us. Again we landed upon some luck, as it only gave us slight scrapes<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>and cuts.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Running for our lives, we headed for the mines. The mine was the only thing that would provide</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">us with adequate protection from the flying beast. Screaming as we ran, Whoabear shouted "Dragon!" Out of the blue, a distance voiced called back to us. "Where are you?!" We spent the next few minutes yelling out to the voice. Eventually,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">three men on horses rode over the mountain, the Dragon having gotten bored and flew barely out of view. They told us it was safe to come out, which we did graciously. They introduced themselves, offered us a large payment for the location of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">the Dragon, and then started to head out. We followed these three; Sharpcastle33, Muffinman, and mbach321, as they unintentionally inspired us. With our strange lust to murder a beast that could eat us in a blink of an eye, we ran</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 48</a><div class="page-content">after the Dragon Slayers. Trying to keep up, we trailed behind the three of them as they shot flaming arrows at the great beast. I grabbed my bow from my shoulder and when I got close enough I aimed at the Dragon. Only two of my arrows hit the scaled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">beast, but it seemed to have barely any effect. Yet I was determined to help fell this evil that had tried destroying the place I had just started calling home.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> After an entire day and night of chasing the Dragon around the mountain, Sharp</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">let fly one last arrow, and the giant black lizard fell from the sky. There was much celebration between the three others, with only brief glances our way. Finally Sharp told us to meet him by our small hut we had made in the past few days.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content"> Three of us, met with the Dragon slayer Sharp and he gave us thirty-two cubic blocks of diamonds. This was a ridiculous amount for a little information, but we were too stunned to say anything. We stammered out a few thank you's, but Sharp had already</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">turned and left. Looking at each other, we quickly decided to hide the wealth we had stumbled upon, and get back to building.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> A few more days passed, and we had finished the tavern. Done with his project, Shock started building himself a mansion,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 48</a><div class="page-content">though he insisted it was just a house. Whoabear had finished the farm and set about building a bakery, why a bakery needs three stories I cannot tell you. All the while, I had continued to labor in my mine, occsionally taking a break by replanting trees</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 48</a><div class="page-content">around the area. We were going through resources as fast as we could get them, but we were making progress, and that's what mattered.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Deciding to name our home in honor of what it gave us those first few nights, we named our new village New Haven.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">It was a simple name, one that we felt painted a picture of what we wanted and viewed the place to become. A single birch tree had sprouted near our temporary house. so we pinned a sign to it in commemoration.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Barely over a week had passed before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">we found some of the others who had agreed to travel to this land arrived at our village. Word had been sent to them, even if we were not sure they would receive it. Suddenly we found our numbers increasing. Frank123823 was the first to arrive.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He informed us that others were on the way, so we set about deciding on how things would be run. It was agreed that the four of us would have control over a certain set of responsibilities. Whoabear was in charge of the town's agriculture and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">building placement, Shock took responsibility for diplomacy with the kingdoms around us, resource division and control was handled by Frank, while I was in charge of the town's security. It was at that moment that the idea for something larger</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">than just our town started to form.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Over the next two days, AmethystRemenant, Beavha, and Wheredugo42 arrived. They set about the tasks we gave them and suddenly we had our town! Houses had sprung up, animals had been found and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 48</a><div class="page-content">started to be raised, crops grew and food was accessible.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Yet, things felt hollow. The reason for coming to this new land was to set our way of doing things, as much as it was to build a new home. A small city and our small group was not enough to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">fulfill this desire. A country, not a town, is what suited us. During all this time, Shock had been talking to other kingdoms and countries (I, to a much lesser extent, had been as well) and told us that a new country would not be disputed in the area</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 48</a><div class="page-content">we settled. A map was fashioned and border lines were planned. All we needed was a name.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Names can be hard, especially when they carry so much weight. A country's name must convey in some way the ideals and formation of itself. Our place was one we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">wanted were everyone worked together towards building a better place, and so our name should reflect that. Back in our old land we had built a small company called the Coop, an exploration and trade group. It was this group that was now</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">settling in New Haven, so the name had some merit. But, it felt unfinished, too short and bland for a new nation. I suggested the Cooperative, a name that explained perfectly our ideals while keeping a hold on our past. Concern was voiced over it sounding</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 48</a><div class="page-content">too much like a company, but ultimately it was the name we agreed upon.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Even though Shock was in charge of foreign affairs, I took it upon myself to send a message to every nation of our founding. I was excited and wanted to be the one to share</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">the good news. A little pride in one's nation never hurts.
