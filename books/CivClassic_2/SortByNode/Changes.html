<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">These days, I don't see so well. But I see enough. I know the score. This guy thinks he's got a monster problem. Where I'm standing, he's looking like the monster.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I didn't have a care in the world, the first time I saw him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He offered me food!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I thought he was the greatest - first time I'd ever seen anyone move their arms, and he didn't have a massive head, or a weird nose, either. So I followed him - why not?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Ended up in a pen. Wasn't so bad at first... he was gone a lot, but he found me a friend pretty quick. He'd come out every day, sometimes TWICE a day, and he'd feed us! I always loved that part. But it got real crowded, real fast.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He didn't seem to notice. Or, I thought he didn't. The pen never got any bigger.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then the massacres started. First, food - then, fear. A dozen little ones meant a dozen deaths. It was horrible!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I'd stick to the back of the pen, while he ran back and forth hacking at the others in the front - he'd disappear into the house with their remains, and I could smell them cooking. Every day, we'd feed, breed, and be slaughtered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I watched so many of them die. It was such a sudden change. And there was nowhere for us to go.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then the seasons changed. I didn't even know there was such a thing, but I guess it was the dry season before, because the rainy season came,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">and it seemed like it would rain every other day - sometimes for a couple of days at a time. The massacres continued, didn't matter what the weather was. Rain, sun, it was all the same.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He'd come out with food, leave with our meat, and we were powerless to do anything about it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was raining on the day my eyesight got bad. He was just approaching the pen. It was real loud that day. Real loud.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Just after the feeding, I remember a bright light - thought I'd been hit, and maybe I was meat today. But not everything went black... just on one side. That's not quite right either, it just got real blurry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Turns out, I could actually see a lot more out of my good eye - like I'd been raised up, without jumping or anything. Boy, did he look different - I could see him eye to eye now, and wasn't that strange.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Next thing I knew, the gates were open! He'd taken my change for a sign, he was letting us go! I ran out as soon as I could get to the gate - and he shut it behind me. Ran up ahead of me, too...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">and I watched him massacre every one of my newly freed friends. It was a trick! A lie! I was paralyzed with fear that I'd be next... but my body felt strange.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I didn't run away - instead, I sort of walked casually, like I might be able to blend in to the normal landscape and saunter away without being recognized.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>No such luck.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">It wasn't too long before he was back, but he put away his weapon. He was RIGHT up in my personal space, though - I didn't object, I was too scared. He pushed me around, and wouldn't you know it, I eventually ended up in another pen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Right next to my friends - the ones that were left. They didn't seem to recognize me, though.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This pen is even smaller - doesn't even have a door. I think I'm a prisoner. And I think I'm going nuts, too.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Sometimes, out of the corner of my eye, I can catch a glimpse of a little black... something, hovering over my head. But I can't catch a good look. It's like it disappears when I<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>lift my head.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">And every day, I watch him come out with the food - and then brandish his sword. Every day I watch him massacre even more of my friends.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Yeah, when the sun goes down, I see a few monsters come out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 19</a><div class="page-content">They never did cause me any trouble, though. Plus, they disappear when the sun comes up.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He doesn't.</div></div>
