<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It began merely as the dream of two brothers in arms, looking for a new life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content">A life of adventure and success, taking wealth from the rich and privileged and lowering them to the level of the common man. The first step to the foundation was to get the necessary capital to begin, leading to the first heist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We robbed as much as we could and left fat and happy, but without a place to store our goods. We used a local tavern as our temporary base of operations. We built some chests and buried them to keep them safe and secure from prying eyes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">until we got a more permanent residence. For our base, we had to find somewhere hidden, but still nearby. We finally settled on hiding it beneath a deep lake at the bedrock. It's a decent place, two bedrooms, an entry hall, and a modest melon farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We have one room dedicated to exceptional loot with a cart going around it. Once the base was set up, we went out for another round of robbery. On this heist, we again went to Aristopolis.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We targeted every large house and stole everything that wasn't bolted to the floor. We went into a large tower via a dirt tower we built and began rummaging around. I remained up top and stole what was there whilst CockBane rummaged around below.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">One local law enforcement agent spotted him, inquiring as to who the proper owner of the house was. I jumped and landed in the water and quickly began speeding away while CockBane attempted to follow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We managed to escape unpearled, but we had been branded as thieves. We tried to wait in the guild until it all blew over, but it seemed as though they weren't going to stop looking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We finally decided it would be best just to turn ourselves in and take the pearling after CockBane was pearled while attempting further theft. The End is dull, painfully so. There are many people, but nothing else but endstone and endermen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">There was no wood or anything else from which to build anything. When finally we were unpearled, we just went back to our life of crime, but were more cautious this time. There's a war now, between the HCF and the CivCrafters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">It's taken the entire world by surprise, griefers run rampant and there's not enough police to stop them all. This seems like a perfect time to loot where they've been, cleaning up after them, but they would take all the blame.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We now loot as opportunity allows and have accumulated a small fortune consisting of a few stacks of rail, numerous stacks of stone and netherrack as well as netherbrick, countless stacks of melon, numerous</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content">diamond weapons and tools, all of powerful enchantment, three enchanted bows, three stacks of redstone, two stacks of iron, and 19 diamonds, all of which are hidden within our base behind locked chests.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Our fortune is modest, but will only grow as we buy nothing and continually increase our stock through theft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We may eventually set up shops to sell unneeded materials, mostly stolen, to give our members a more public and respectable face. We may even become involved in politics eventually and control a small hamlet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We don't, however, plan to expand our membership as it is not certain that the recruits would be trustworthy enough to know our location and have access to our loot.</div></div>
