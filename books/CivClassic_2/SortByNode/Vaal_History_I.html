<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Here is a document of the reasons why on the next page.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>1. No aid which was promised was given. Besides Sharp, Wyck nor did other Fed members give supplies promised at the negoitions made 2 weeks prior to this document.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">2. The Wyck-Fed alliance have began warmongering. We at Vaal will not risk our lives for causes we care little for.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3. We want to preserve Neutrality and cannot reach this goal by remaining with the Alliance.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 49</a><div class="page-content">   So it was done, and the Wardens of Vaal left the Wyck-Fed alliance.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>An hour or so later, GetNGoing, leader of the Morian military, and Luni, began telling robbylynn12 of the threat that is the Wyck-Fed alliance and congratulating Vaal</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 49</a><div class="page-content">for leaving. They talked about it as Vaal's opprotunity to enact revenge for the actions done upon them by the Federation. Scared for their lives and fueled by patriotism, robbylynn12 made a Warden's vote to go to war. Senetrix immediately said yes,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Awolz was reluctant, but agreed to. Binita agreed and wanted to get into the action asap (He was deemed the Military leader of Vaal at the time.) So the Wardens packed up and met up with the Coalition at Greyshore.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">With them was brought one of the most sacred items to all Vaalians - The Red Flag of Revolution. They flew this flag at the Greyshore lighthouse to rally the coalition and began their trek to Fort Blackwell to retaliate against the Wyck-Fed forces.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Fort Blackwell was already defeated by the Coalition Vanguard, but they still proudly marched through. robbylynn12 then exclaimed the famous line "Down with the toll!" which he then proceeded with Binita to attempt to blow up the toll booth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Before their departure, Awolz went back to the CC temple to give respects and robbylynn12 repaired some griefing made by Coalition members. Revelations were also revealed later that night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Coconutbrother9, a close friend of the Wardens, revealed he ratted them out to The Federation that they were hiding in Vosis which led to the demise of jbejmitchell and HPZ_k0d.

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Peace was then negotiated by Winton and Luni and a new era dawned for the Wardens of Vaal, for the shadow of the Federation no longer haunted their every waking minute.</div></div>
