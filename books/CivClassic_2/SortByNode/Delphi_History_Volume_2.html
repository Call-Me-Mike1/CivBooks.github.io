<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Back in August, I had created a plan called Operation Deathstroke that was a plan to crush the Delphi base.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">The reason is because of Laganstoop's urge to threaten, cuck, and be an overall annoyance to the pre-Omega group at the time. That group was MCG, GoddessDirt, Ariaha, mtS_, and SnipinNukes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Over time, the annoyance and overall autism from Lagan made us all tired of that shit, to a point where we created what is known as "Deathstroke"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We worked to find clues and hints about the base, tracking members movements<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>(<span class="fmtf"><span class="fmtcode">§f</span>.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>especially laganstoops<span class="fmtf"><span class="fmtcode">§f</span>.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>) through the nether.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We eventually figured out that the base was around 40,000 x+, just because of how long it took Lagan to reach SnipinNukes for a meeting point.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">From there we got pictures of the Delphi base, and continued to search for it on the overworld Z axis. We assumed for it to be on the Z- axis, however most of us had shit to do by then, and the entire operation had been called off by me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Most of us just continued to play or just quit for a while until a point where Goddess started talking to m4vincent, and SirLeonidas about joining Delphi.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">As soon as we were told this, we opened the operation back up and then continued to attempt to join forces with Delphi. The plan was to take a Dragon Egg from Delphi, and destroy the base entirely.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content">As soon as we joined forces, we went to the base from SCAR. We had noticed in our final calculations (<span class="fmtf"><span class="fmtcode">§f</span>.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>from around the end of August when the operation was abandoned) that X:40,000 Z:-5000 was pretty close to the Delphi hideout,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content">at least if I can remember correctly. We had stayed there for a day, and told SirLeonidas our plans. We already knew that when we gave him coords to Square-one, and mtS_ coords to SCAR, that they would fall along with Delphi.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">That might have been a stupid idea, but just like Delphi - we also had a back-up base. In the end, we were going to grief Delphi either way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content">By the time we noticed suspicious activity, we knew that they were going to kill us while we were either afk, or out in the open. Goddess mistook judgement, decided to afk for gunpowder, and got rekt by m4's crystal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content">They decided to self-grief the base, however they left pretty much all of the base intact. Since Goddess and I took all of their gunpowder when we got there, there wasn't anything besides hardcore mining, crystals, or lava to grief with.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">When I came back on, Delphi crew was already gone and I started the hardcore mining, tnt, and all of that shit. A little bit later, Ebola joined in on the griefing task, and we started raping everything.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 30</a><div class="page-content">There were some others that came to find loot and things, but Delphi had pretty much taken a bit of everything. Not everything was gone, but pretty much enough stuff to ya-know "loot" or whatever.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Just go watch it on Scar News if you want to know more about that shit. Goddess would have joined griefing if he didnt die every time he came to the portal, lmao that was fucking hilarious.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 30</a><div class="page-content">He got there the second day and started doing shit, but me and ebola basically kek'd almost everything by then. By the end of the 3rd day of the leak, Delphi was griefed and all over. They were still pissed, and raging all of that.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Deathstroke had been completed, and we really didnt care anymore. I went to our base, and we continued to build and shit there. Scar & Square-one were griefed while we were griefing Delphi.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Leo didn't get to touch Square-one as much as I did. I basically mined everything there, and shit like that. It wasn't a great base, but it was something i was attempting to make "huge".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 30</a><div class="page-content">I eventually just echested and /kill from that 1m+, because i didnt want to fucking walk anymore ecks dee. Scar's portals were broke and cobble monstered, but someone really dedicated could go and repair it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We just left it as is, Goddess basically just mined tons of obsidian for that farm, me as well.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So it was a loss on our hands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 30</a><div class="page-content">At the end of the day, Delphi was destroyed from the inside. I have no interest in arguing over anything, and that's that. This is for you retards that don't know what happened at that grief, trying to assume some fucked up garbage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Delphi is a kind and gentle group, and instead of quitting like fags, they just moved on from the destruction of a 6 month old base. Respect, brother, respect.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Leonidas and crew are some respectful individuals, and i wish them best of luck for future endeavors.</div></div>
