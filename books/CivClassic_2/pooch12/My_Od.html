<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------Jul 6 '17 cont'd<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. After last book ran out of pages, I found a pleasant little town called Craiggard next to a river at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 24</a><div class="page-content">1900 -950. One of the residents is generous enough to grant me a feather to construct this book, and I found a squid to kill for ink sacs in the nearby river. With the leather from the desert cow herds, the wild sugarcane I found, I created a second</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 24</a><div class="page-content">volume of this book before sailing east down the river and into a swamp, before finding a stone bridge between a couple landmasses, between a forest of giant spruces and oak trees and a little town called Heinlau at 2170 -820, then boat up another river</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 24</a><div class="page-content">to the northeast.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2. The river takes me to yet another town called Craigrock, with a bridge leading off to somewhere called Craigia. Wow, sounds like these people like Craig a lot. I leave this modified testificate village and boat north to a lake</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content">or whatever. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3. I follow some rivers east until ending up in a swamp around 3170 -1580. I had passed through a swamp and a tall spruce/oak forest with a testificate village before reaching the Craigs nation and getting another book, by the way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">4. I sail east across a lake before winding up in swamp again, then find a trail roughly along the x: 3425 at 3420 -1650. I take it north, and then it curves northeastward winding through the swamp, discovering that it leads to a place called New Draycott</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Supposedly, the other end is someplace called Crowsroost.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>5. "New Draycott" turns out to be a little dinky house with a tiny little carrot farm along the swampwater at 3810 -2260. Oh well, onward to the book depository place, which I hope has a good</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">book collection I can explore. I planned it as an alternate route home around the ghastly boring, strenuous terrain I'd encountered on my way from Yoahtl to CW, but in hindsight it was kind of a bad idea.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>6. Sailing north leads me through an ocean,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">bringing me to a flower forest atop tall cliffs at 4030 -3010. Scaling the cliffs gets me to what looks like a medieval cathedral or some other big structure at 4120 -3030, which turns out to be the rail station of Nevada. The mysterious 4220 -3120 place</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">advertised in CW for book donations is apparently Nevada, a medieval-themed town with people that don't immediately murder me. Thankful for the good luck there. The book deposit is just a hopper to a personal chest of Squareblob's, and he takes short</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">fiction and Braille novellas. There will apparently be a library here soon, but not now. I leave, and return to the New Draycott shack.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>7. I head south on the path towards Crowsroost. It's a small, medieval styled town that's apparently part of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">a nation called Verda, although I also saw signs indicating Greenmarsh and Axusgrad here. It looks nice, but I must sail back home, apparently to move to CW again since Yoahtl is having an exodus due to the Laconia thing. I meet a testificate village at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">3430 -1000 while heading back to the +,+ down various rivers, passing by Normandy around 3480 -380, but not visiting. I have valuables to pack up.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>8. I cross back into the +,+ at x: 3580 and continue sailing. I sail across a sea and meet with a mesa</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">around 3300 600, then sail around it southwest until 3210 720, then scale the mesa, which turns out to not exactly be a shortcut as I could've just gone around west. I continue on until running into a stairway up to Ponsportia at 3160 960.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">I don't find anything up the stairs except a path somewhere, so I just go back to the water and boat south, passing a mushroom island between z: 2050 and z: 2200 east of x: 3220.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>9. I meet desert at 3230 3070, devoid of cacti except for one small farm</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">around 3220 3320. There's a forest up a cliff here, which I scale to find another farm, then continue southward through what turns out to be taiga, meeting the sea again at 3220 3950 and sailing south yet again. I meet mesa across the sea at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">3190 4870, and see a nice bridge way up at the top. No matter, I head through a pass back to water again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>10. I meet mesa again at 3200 5850 and go around to the southwest, then meet a savanna plateau at 3060 6030 and have to go around that, before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">reaching open ocean again. The exodus party wants to rendezvous at 1047 5545, so I'll meet them there.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>11. It's smooth sailing all the way down to the Popec at 3250 10720, which I follow southeast to Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">12. I pack up, leave a few signs behind lamenting Yoahtl's death, then leave for the rendezvous point. I pass a nether island I hadn't noticed southwest of 2750 9080, and another east of 2000 7860.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>13. At 660 6860, I can't go around the land anymore, so I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">must hike through it. At 510 6880, I walk by megatrees while going through this oak forest. Infuriatingly, it turns into mountains I have to scale but I make it around to the sea again at 230 6820.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>14. I sail into the -,+ to stay at z: 6790, meeting more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">mega oak trees as I pass by a shore of an oak <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>forest....which<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> I can't go around, and must hike through.. with more steep hills.. FUCK. 15. At least I see water again at -540 6570... to have to get off and hike again at -940 6430.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>16. I get to water</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">again by -1730 5960... until I have to go through EVEN MORE OF THE GODDAMN HILLY FOREST by -1900 6020, until -1970 6020 when I get to the ocean again. FINALLY!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>17. I find someone's homestead in the middle of the sea at -2270 5830. I sail off and find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 24</a><div class="page-content">a mushroom island at -2700 5600, which has a herd of mooshrooms, one of which I take along with me.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>18. The closest I can get to my new home with my mooshroom is -5960 3720, so I'll leave him here and head over since this has taken long enough already.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 24</a><div class="page-content">19. I have to cross a river, but I finally make it to the refugee camp at -6550 3970. Finally, I've made it. I set a bed and go to sleep, and this odyssey is over.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
