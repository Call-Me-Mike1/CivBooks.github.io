<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------I first joined Civclassics sometime near it's beginning in early Summer 2017. I played on a different account at the time and made my way to the Commonwealth to join some friends of mine who had set</div></div>

I was very disinterested in Minecraft as whole though so I logged off almost as soon as I had arrived there.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------About three months later in September 2017 I was asked by Figasaur if I wanted to join him in Yoahtl where he had just built a house. Neither of us were fond of Bg even then but I decided it'd</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 45</a><div class="page-content">be fun to just mess around with Fig and to not take the game too seriously. When I arrived, I found that Fig had created a beautiful house in the center of Yoahtl. The town was very different and much poorer than it is today. We were enjoying ourselves,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 45</a><div class="page-content">messing around and just building when all of a sudden The_Orange_Wizard and bgbba started telling us to leave Yoahtl. We hadn't done anything except talk in chat so of course we didn't take these threats too seriously. Back then the full extent of Bg's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 45</a><div class="page-content">instability and authoritarianism wasn't known to us, and so we just stayed in the house while a small crowd formed outside. Then, as Fig and I were comparing our situation to that of Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Bg broke down the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 45</a><div class="page-content">door and pearled us both. Back then there was no exile mechanic for pearling. Thus, we were damned to the End for literally nothing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------I cannot stress to you enough how awful being pearled in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 45</a><div class="page-content">early Civclassics was. There was no exile mechanic and the End was awful. I spent the next seven months in the End. Sometime in that span of time I was moved from the Yoahtl vault to the Hjaltland vault. It wasn't that big a deal because I wasn't very</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 45</a><div class="page-content">interested in Minecraft even then but I still missed out on the Somber War as well as the founding of Kaliningrad. During those seven months, I occasionally reached out to Bg and Bluesylvaer to ask why I was being held for such a long time. I was given a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 45</a><div class="page-content">myriad of excuses, everything from doxxing accusations to me being a HCF super soldier sent to invade the server. Needless to say, I was unjustly pearled for the better half of a year. It was not until April 2018 that I saw the light of day.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------When I had finally been exiled the first thing I did was make my way to Mt Augusta. Fig had already set up there and had built the clocktower and the Starbucks. It was a pain to maneuver in MtA</div></div>

At the time, MtA was embroiled in drama between the communists and the NUP, who was led by Kdeeks. I more or less stayed neutral in the competition. Fig</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 45</a><div class="page-content">and I were more concerned with building around the Starbucks. Wanting to get in on the political situation of MtA, I began building the Incel Party HQ, which today is the Womp Womp Industries building. However, one night, tragedy struck. I still remember</div></div>

On June 8th there was a riot going on near the voter tree. I was just watching the commotion, when all of a sudded, Droidjoe, a member of the MtA militia, said that he had accidentally dropped his sword and that someone had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 45</a><div class="page-content">picked it up. He demanded that everyone screenshot their inventories and send the pic to him to prove they didn't have it.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------What followed this incident was the full scale mobilization of all anti-semites on the server against the Jewish Quarter. We endured attacks from Jonassn1, who sued us</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 45</a><div class="page-content">for creating a map, by Crybaby Callum who would threaten us with violence, and The_Hobbyist who would spread lies and try to run us out of the city.

<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 45</a><div class="page-content">returned since.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------Steady progress was being made on the JQ</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 45</a><div class="page-content">throughout July and August despite these attacks though. The Apple Store was created along with the Koshermart. The Columbian embassy was made along with the now-defunct food court. But on August 28th, true disaster struck. While Fig and I were offline,</div></div>

Later dubbed "Obbynacht", the JQ was attacked and nearly destroyed by the the crazed anti-semite. Having recieved supplies and funding from Higgenbottoms, puppyface had not only attacked the JQ</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 45</a><div class="page-content">ingame but also in a crazy manifesto in which he declared an anti-semitic fatwa upon all Jews. What followed was a string of obby bombings that shook the JQ to it's core. First puppyface, then just a few days later we were hit again by Charlameme. A week</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 45</a><div class="page-content">later we were hit by Blackskorm, who was later revealed to be the alt of known anti-semite C4MNO.

<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 45</a><div class="page-content">few weeks. And just like the hate campaign that occurred earlier in the summer, the MtA government sat by and did nothing. In fact, they even helped aid the griefers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------      Chapter Seven<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------The JQ has had many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 45</a><div class="page-content">run ins with the corrupt Judges of MtA, but two particular cases take the cake for the sheer anti-semitism they displayed. The first incident occurred when Figasaur was taken to court and found guilty for cleaning up Puppyface's obby grief in the JQ.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 45</a><div class="page-content">Judge CRIMEo, whose mind was so detioriated and feeble from the countless nights of having Hobbyist whisper in his ear, somehow interpreted the MtA law to outlaw citizens from cleaning up grief that occurred on their own property. Fig was pearled and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 45</a><div class="page-content">forced to serve out a sentence for simply cleaning up grief that was placed on his property. Truly the all time low point for MtA law. The second incident was when Puppyface, who had come back after vowing to quit, faked snitch logs in attempt to pin me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 45</a><div class="page-content">for breaking into a bunker he had created in creative mode single player. He made an elaborate post in which he accused me of breaking his bunker and the snitch logs looked very real. I was then pearled by Crybaby Callum almost immediately for these</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 45</a><div class="page-content">falsified claims. I then had to make a post identifying all the ways in which I could not have done the crime. Puppyface had refused to have another person verify the snitches, had refused to unblock the coordinates from the original post so that the site</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 45</a><div class="page-content">could be inspected, and had even had errors in the formatting of his snitch logs. I even acquainted myself with how to falsify snitch logs to help demonstrate just how easy they could be falsified. Finally, for reasons that still aren't clear, puppyface</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 45</a><div class="page-content">admitted to faking the logs. I was freed but not given my items back by Crybaby Callum, and the MtA judges refused to compensate me for the time and money I had lost while being held by them. These events contributed to us Jews pursuing a more hardline</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------Since those incidents, the JQ has more or less neutralized it's enemies in MtA. After nearly a six month campaign</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 45</a><div class="page-content">of attacks and plots to destroy the JQ, most anti semites have either quit or have left MtA. The Jewish Quarter has gone from a weak and fragile burough of MtA to the most influential and powerful group on the server. The Jewish Quarter is often referred</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 45</a><div class="page-content">to as the cultural center of the server, with several cultural hotspots such as the Little Amitz Warrior Theater and the Little Tel Aviv Synogogue being in the JQ. JQ citizens are some of the most wealthy and educated players, and are very well respected.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 45</a><div class="page-content">As the year draws to a close, I look back on the JQ, it's founding and it's growth to what it is today with pride. Pride in knowing that we have overcome the impossible and that whatever we Jews face from here on out will most certainly be easier to deal</div></div>
