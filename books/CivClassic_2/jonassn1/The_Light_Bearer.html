<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the beginning there where only darkness, and rain. Where the darkness and the rain meet the sea spawned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After a millenia or two, a goddess was born from the waves on the</div></div>

She swam and swam, however she did not find rest. Soon her heart grew as cold as the wind blowing over the endless sea in the darkness. To punish the darkness and the sea, she forced the darkness</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 32</a><div class="page-content">down into part of the sea, forceing it away,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>she created land of the darkness, and used it to keep the water at bay.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She sleeped for a time, and when she awoke she looked into the darkness, and feel it needed to be punished more, so she forced some of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">the ground into the sky, creating a square, the moon. However she couldn't really see it, since there still was darkness over the world. So she then forced some of the water into the air, she splitted it and mixed it with dirt creating the first tree. She</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">then sat the tree on fire, it branches reaches all across the world sky, and for a bit there was day, hovever soon the darkness began to combat the light, and it soon succed in limiting the fire, however the fire keep burning in several branches and in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">some leaves, and thus the night sky's stars was bringed into existence.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The goddess layed down on her back, looking at the stars and her moon, but soon that wasn't enough either and she decided to bring mortal life into the world she first</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">created the zombies, the skeletons, the spiders and the creppers. She took a great delight in watching them fight, but even though she now had entertainment she didn't grew tired of she wasn't satisfied, no the world were dark and dull, except the stars.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">She wanted colors and light on the ground as well, so she gave birth to a boy, and made him a gift, a lantern, which would enlighten the world, and thus giveing life to the flowers and the grass and the trees.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Her son, the Light Bearer, began to wander</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">the world, where he went his light fell on the ground giving life, and chasing the darkness away, and whereever he went his light outshined the stars and the moon.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He watched the world for a time, soon he grew to pity the monsters his mother had created,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">both those there burned in his light and those who was forever forced to fight for his mothers entertainment.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He took the crepper, and cured tried to cure it with his light, and the crepper's body shrank, and it bended, is face changed,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">its skin turned into a healthy pink color.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Light Bearer took the zomie, and blasted it with his light, but it burned to death. And the Light Bearer cried, his tears crystilizeing and soon getting incapsled by rocks.  He then went and trained</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">with his lamp, he tried to blast it's light on the ground as quickly as it he could, it melted the stone.  After that he returned to the zombies, and blasted  it with the light, however it didn't cure it, but mearly turned it into ash in seconds.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The Light bearer cried once again over the loss of life, then he proced to think. And he tried to solidify some of his light, creating a golden metal, he tried to feed the zombie it, but it wouldn't digest it, he then tried to make it into dust, but the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">zombie wouldn't eat it, so he infused the dust into an apple wich he then feed the zombie.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The zombie began to shake and then transformed into a villager. The Light Bearer smiled, and began to cure the other zombies, after he did that, he watched</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">them for a while. Then he sat the lantern down on the ground, and laied down next to it, to sleep.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After a few years of sleep, he awoke and discorved that the area around him had changed. Molten rock where all over the place, the dirt had changed color,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 32</a><div class="page-content">and some kind of flying glowing mob had spawned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Light Bearer sat up, confused as what had caused this change. And then his eye fell on the lantern, and he was enlighten. Around the lantern was the largest lava pool, he then swore to never stay</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">long enough the same place to provoke such a biomchange.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He began to wander the earth, moving the lantern with him. Once in a while he would pause, either to cure more monsters or to watch the villagers build their homes. He soon realised that they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">had no natural defense, and thus relied on building walls. Therefore he picked up some of the ground and melted it with his lantern. It soon smelted to a grey liquid, which he formed into a large, bulky, humanoid construct. Even though it had a finished</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 32</a><div class="page-content">body it din't came to life, the Light Bearer studied it for a time, and then realised that his construct was different from his cured creatures since it didn't had the element of life inside it. He picked a poppy from the ground and put it into the chest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 32</a><div class="page-content">of the construct.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A second passed by, then two, then three and then suddenly the construcks eyes lighted up. He had done it, the Light Bearer had created his first living being.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He carefully sat the construct down on the ground, in the middle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 32</a><div class="page-content">of the village, and he watched as it smashed a zombie away from a scared villager.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Light Bearer smiled to himself, knowing that he had succeded in his task, to protect the villagers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He then began to wander once again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Soon he realised that he wanted to cure the skeletons as well, but he doubted he could do it it the same way as the zombies, since they didn't had any flesh. Therefore he collected the remains of some of the zombies, and mixed it with his hardned light.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 32</a><div class="page-content">He made chestplates, boots, leggins and helmets of the infused flesh. He then put it on a skeleton and blasted it with light. The skeleton started to burn, but the Light Bearer tossed the burning skeleton in the water, and waited for the smoke to clear.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Something began to swim up from the water, the Light Bearer watched with cutiosity at this new being.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The humanoid looked around, but somehow failed to see the Light Bearer over him, he only saw his lantern.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He walked over to a tree and started to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">punch it. He clearly was of a different sort than the villagers. The Light Bearer continued to watch the humanoid, but he also remembered to cure more monsters and to travel the world so the lantern doesn't burn the ground again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">While all this happened the Mother looked with curiosity on the Light Bearer's actions, she didn't understand them. But she found it amusing, but she insisted on watching the mobs fight, so every time he cured some, she spawned more into the world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The Light Bearer began to wonder why, the monster population didn't fall, after all he knew that they couldn't breed, that was a trait limited to his cured monsters.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He then began to investigate, and soon realised that the Mother contined to spawn them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 32</a><div class="page-content">into existense. They fought...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 32</a><div class="page-content">And for a while the Mother had the upper hand, but a humanoid saw the sky was alight, and that the lantern's light was fadeing. He screamed in terror, and soon the humanoids started to meet together in prayers to the gods, they didn't knew who they where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 32</a><div class="page-content">praying to, but they knew that he or she carried the lantern.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And the Light Bearer started to glow, and he began to gain the upper hand.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And soon he vanished his mother to the end.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The Light Bearer looked happy at the humanoids, and decided to grant them the knowledge of the earth, he learned them to craft metal tools.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Soon he also granted a humanoid visions and glimps of the truth, behind the world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He became his first</div></div>
