<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Ah, the Chairman. It didn't take long for his image to fill my mind - tall, handsome, his white beard framing his grizzled face. Indeed, it would take me another two minutes to get heading to</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  But I did eventually get going, as any good Pripyatonian should. On my commute, I saw my fellow workers, and neighbors going about</div></div>
