        Art of War

THE OLDEST MILITARY           TREATISE 
      IN THE WORLD

   Translated from             Chinese by:
   LIONEL GILES, M.A.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Chapter I. 
LAYING PLANS

1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 100</a><div class="page-content">which can on no account be neglected.

3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 100</a><div class="page-content">4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

5, 6. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 100</a><div class="page-content">7. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

8. Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 100</a><div class="page-content">9. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.

10. By Method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 100</a><div class="page-content">subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

11.These five heads should be familiar to every general:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 100</a><div class="page-content">he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.

12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 100</a><div class="page-content">13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 100</a><div class="page-content">(5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment? 

14. By means of these seven considerations...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 100</a><div class="page-content">I can forecast victory or defeat.

15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 100</a><div class="page-content">will suffer defeat:—let such a one be dismissed! 

16. While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 100</a><div class="page-content">17. According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.

18. All warfare is based on deception.

19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 100</a><div class="page-content">when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.

20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 100</a><div class="page-content">21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.

22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 100</a><div class="page-content">23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.

24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 100</a><div class="page-content">26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 100</a><div class="page-content">how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

End of Chapter I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Chapter II. WAGING WAR

1. Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 100</a><div class="page-content">the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 100</a><div class="page-content">2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.

3. Again, if the campaign is protracted...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 100</a><div class="page-content">the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.

4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.

5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 100</a><div class="page-content">6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.

7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 100</a><div class="page-content">8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.

9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 100</a><div class="page-content">10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.

11. On the other hand, the proximity of an...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 100</a><div class="page-content">army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.

12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 100</a><div class="page-content">13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 100</a><div class="page-content">breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.

15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the ....</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 100</a><div class="page-content">enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.

16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 100</a><div class="page-content">they must have their rewards.

17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.  Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 100</a><div class="page-content">and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.

18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.

19. In war, then, let your great object..</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 100</a><div class="page-content">be victory, not lengthy campaigns.

20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.

End of Chapter II</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM

1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 100</a><div class="page-content">an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemey's resistance without...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 100</a><div class="page-content">fighting.

3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 100</a><div class="page-content">and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.

4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 100</a><div class="page-content">and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more. 

5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 100</a><div class="page-content">untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.

6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 100</a><div class="page-content">in the field.

7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 100</a><div class="page-content">8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. 

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 100</a><div class="page-content">if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.

11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 100</a><div class="page-content">is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.

12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:—</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 100</a><div class="page-content">13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.

14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 100</a><div class="page-content">obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.

15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 100</a><div class="page-content">16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away. 

17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 100</a><div class="page-content">(1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 100</a><div class="page-content">unprepared.
(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.

18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 100</a><div class="page-content">for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

End of Chapter III</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 100</a><div class="page-content">Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS

1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-51"><a href="#page-51" class="page-indicator">Page 51 of 100</a><div class="page-content">2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.

3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-52"><a href="#page-52" class="page-indicator">Page 52 of 100</a><div class="page-content">defeating the enemy.

4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.

5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-53"><a href="#page-53" class="page-indicator">Page 53 of 100</a><div class="page-content">6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.

7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes...</div></div>

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common...</div></div>

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, "Well done!"

10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-56"><a href="#page-56" class="page-indicator">Page 56 of 100</a><div class="page-content">moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.

11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-57"><a href="#page-57" class="page-indicator">Page 57 of 100</a><div class="page-content">12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.

13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty  of victory, for it means...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-58"><a href="#page-58" class="page-indicator">Page 58 of 100</a><div class="page-content">conquering an enemy that is already defeated.

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-59"><a href="#page-59" class="page-indicator">Page 59 of 100</a><div class="page-content">15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.

16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-60"><a href="#page-60" class="page-indicator">Page 60 of 100</a><div class="page-content">and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.

13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.

14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-73"><a href="#page-73" class="page-indicator">Page 73 of 100</a><div class="page-content">15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.

16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-74"><a href="#page-74" class="page-indicator">Page 74 of 100</a><div class="page-content">or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.

17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.

18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply...</div></div>

19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move...</div></div>

20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-77"><a href="#page-77" class="page-indicator">Page 77 of 100</a><div class="page-content">he lies in wait for him.

21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-78"><a href="#page-78" class="page-indicator">Page 78 of 100</a><div class="page-content">22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-79"><a href="#page-79" class="page-indicator">Page 79 of 100</a><div class="page-content">23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.

1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-81"><a href="#page-81" class="page-indicator">Page 81 of 100</a><div class="page-content">2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.

. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage...</div></div>

4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-83"><a href="#page-83" class="page-indicator">Page 83 of 100</a><div class="page-content">5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected. 

6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-84"><a href="#page-84" class="page-indicator">Page 84 of 100</a><div class="page-content">7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-85"><a href="#page-85" class="page-indicator">Page 85 of 100</a><div class="page-content">8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.

9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-86"><a href="#page-86" class="page-indicator">Page 86 of 100</a><div class="page-content">learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;
and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit...</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-89"><a href="#page-89" class="page-indicator">Page 89 of 100</a><div class="page-content">unaccountable in his way.

13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-90"><a href="#page-90" class="page-indicator">Page 90 of 100</a><div class="page-content">14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-91"><a href="#page-91" class="page-indicator">Page 91 of 100</a><div class="page-content">15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known;  for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible...</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-93"><a href="#page-93" class="page-indicator">Page 93 of 100</a><div class="page-content">should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.

<div class="page" id="page-94"><a href="#page-94" class="page-indicator">Page 94 of 100</a><div class="page-content">18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.
