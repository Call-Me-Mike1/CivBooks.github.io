Sir Terry used to call him 'Lil T' and himself 'Big T'. This immunity is what allowed him to get away with the murder of seven school children. Ted would serve no prison sentence due to the fact that no jailor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 23</a><div class="page-content">could stand the sight of him. Ted was completely grot esque with one councilor remarking that Ted Waters was the equivalent to a 'walking, talking crab-like cowpat.'
This apperance afforded Ted no luxuries in life, he would meet no women and sire no children</div></div>

The twelveth shortest average fingered child was Janet Hussein Waters, with a finger length of a whopping 1.03m. From the beginning, Janet was always a rebel. She was always self conscious about her giant manky fingers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">which lead to her being bullied at school with the name lanky janky Janet.

attached to her.</div></div>

 Fat dumb janky janet would later go on to marry the President of Bloom named Slushhi who admired the ork for her luxurious fingers. The fingers were especially impressive in Bloom where the malnutrition had stunted the growth of many of the town's</div></div>

Todger Banners officiated their marriage 9 years into their relationship. This was a famous event for being the first time a dead man</div></div>
