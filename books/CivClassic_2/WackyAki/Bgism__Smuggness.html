<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Bgbba, the Chieftan of Yoahtl, Eternal crafter of Bg-Posts, creator of the Great Overland Rail, Leader of the Channers and the Tulpas, and he who sacrificed himself.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Bgbba, or Bg for short, is the high God and deity of Bg-ism. True believers of bgism</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">call themselves the "Followers of Bgbba." It's not easy to be a Follower, nor is it a life of glamor and riches. It's a life of subreddit PVP. It's a life of railbuilding. It's a life of being called everything from a loser to a nerd. Take these insults</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">not as offensive, but as complimentary. Our Lord Bg will hear these insults levied unto us and give us tenfold in blessings. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It is essential as a Follower of Bgbba to, whenever possible, take a rail or train to wherever you may seek to travel.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">If there is no rail to your destination, seek to build one or to extend one towards that destination. It is allowed to walk short distances or to use a water craft if need be. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There are deadly sins and hereseys associated with Bgism. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The first of these sins are E-Lawyering. Those who spend all their hours pouring over obscure texts, discord messages and other nations code of law in order to inrich themselves or for the pleasure of being right over promoting what would be fun for all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">are despicable E-Lawyers who have no place in Bg-ism and no place on this server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Second major sin is that of a grid city. Grid cities not only crush creativity, but are ugly, stifle interesting building styles and prevent emergent building</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">styles. It is the duty of every Follower to prevent a grid cities growth or creation, and to promote interesting and emergent city design.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Third deadly sin is Downvoting a Bg-Post. It is our duty and our glory to spread the word of BGBBA to all those</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">around us. So when BGBBA steps down from the Golden Throne from which he lives and was sacrificed for us and writes a message to the degenerates and maggots we are to him, it is our duty to spead his word. Downvoting his post not only silences BGBBA, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">spits in the face of all those who BGBBA was banned to save. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Finally, the last sin of BG-ism is to allow a lack of public transit. Our lord and Emperor created the Great Overland Rail before he was stuck down by the false Gods of Dsclouse, Ibagi and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">LordofMarzipan. It was his wish to spread his rail through all four corners of the map, and for every quadrant to have access to a rail. Do your duty and increase the proliferation of rails.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
