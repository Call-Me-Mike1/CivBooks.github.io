<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Hey Rodge.” He says to me, as he absentmindedly begins to sweat profusely. Every inch of this man was covered in pores, ready to perspire at a moments notice.</div></div>

Surprisingly, he didn’t get the moniker of Sweats by his unfortunate biological condition, it’s because he has a propensity for wearing sweatpants.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Alright, I’m gonna bounce like all my bookie’s checks do”. I reply. I then exit that horrendous little store, and I realize that poor old Stanley is destined to die</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As I make my way through the crowded club, sweet music playing in my ears, my eyes fall on a dame, finer than 1000 grit sandpaper. Fortunately, I am a self-disciplined man who doesn't easily</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I order a drink, water on the rocks, and I turn to Louie. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

I knew what he wanted, and it would cost me, but I wouldn't get anything out of this</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Good man, Louie, good man.” I answer. Louie begins to get up to get more onions, but before he can leave I raise my hand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">“Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.” I say quickly in succession in a deprecating tone, to indicate to Louie that he has perhaps made an infringement in his actions without his knowing. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
