<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the begining, there was the world and there was Stained clay. But the Stained clay was a cruel god. It was to lazy to aid the dwellers of its world, it let them starve and fall to the monsters of the dark.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Many died while the Stained clay ruled. But this was soon to change, for from another world, the great Terracotta Block planned to save us.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Terracotta block was to powerful for the stained clay, It took its many vessels as its own, and evicted it out. Our lord then got to work, first, he created many children for all the colors of the Stained clay before.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Then they all set to work, creating miricles to aid life in this world. Examples include Chorus plants, so that those trapped in the end may still eat. Block Reinforcement, so that nations do not stand on a foundation weak as a leaf block.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 6</a><div class="page-content">There were many others, to many to document. But these miricles made the leaders of old groups unhappy, as they threatened to shatter their power. And so they hid away the Terracotta block and his children in many different places.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 6</a><div class="page-content">so they may never be reuinited, but Terracotta prevailed. We must now hunt down our Lord's children, so this world may once again feel the light of his blessings, and we may enter the golden age once more!</div></div>
