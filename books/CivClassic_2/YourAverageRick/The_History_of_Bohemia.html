<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Bohemia is a little known province of the Second Empire of Columbia, located in the deep northwestern quadrant, brushing up right against the Varkonian Protectorate Kaiserreich. It's had a storied, albeit relatively unknown, past.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">In the early days of Civclassics 2.0, before Columbia even formed, a group of unknown settlers made a small settlement near Norfolk, a ruined fishing village that used to be the provincial capital. All that remains is a tavern and a mysterious temple.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">What is most interesting is that this wasn't some random newfriend town, <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>as <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">As Columbia formed in October of 2017, and Rotterdam, the capital, developed, they started looking around more of their claims. Then Mayor of Rotterdam, Deuterian/Destroyer_89, built a highway system snaking across the fledgeling kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Going from Rotterdam all the way to present day Hallow, to Apoland, and to Bohemia, it was a massive feat of engineering that, no doubt, took many weeks to accomplish. Eventually, an unknown Columbian built a small shack and a flagpole on Norfolk Island,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>During the Columbia-Kaiserreich-Lusitania shitfest/cold war, Kaiserreich built a bit of infrastructure illegally in Bohemia, but nothing too bad. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">By this point, the region was renamed to Grosskaseland, german for "Big cheese land", and Labig set about building homes and small farming settlements throughout the mountains, bringing much needed life to the desolate region.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">When the NATO-Mir war broke out in late January, Columbia was plunged into a lengthy dark age. After the fall of the Sempiternal Vault, all Columbians evacuated to the Hallow Vault further west, abandoning even Rotterdam. Not a soul stepped foot in</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In early august of that same year, Labigcheese became active again, and he hatched a plan. He would recruit people to make a city outside of the scope of the war - where Columbians could peacefully build</div></div>

Comrade Rick of Caledonia (aka me) saw Labig debate shade in the Columbia discord, and Labig told him of his plan. I agreed to help. So on my alt, I made the trek up to Columbia. I braved the mob-infested roads of the Deuterian Highway, I</div></div>

Eventually recruiting newfriend Columbian Hasaabitt, we set about making resources for our settlement. Within the first 48 hours, we had set up an iron tool forge, an aestethics factory, and a charcoal maker.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">With the industrial backbone completed, we set about grinding materials and making designs - swiftly planning the roads, a church, and some huts. I set up a bakery, and after we had completed more buildings, we discussed how to procceed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Labig tossed around the idea of recruiting Lemur to scavenge in Rotterdam, since he was already pearled, there was no harm in asking, however he declined. We then proceeded to decide to keep to ourselves, setting up farms and the occasional building.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Around a week in, Labig's greed had gotten the better of him. He had claimed not just Lenze and the surrounding abandoned settlement, but all of Grosskaseland and some more land - totalling 1/3 of Columbia. After being pearled by Sirboss</div></div>

Hasaa escaped to... wherever he goes (maybe the mysterious Uetty place?) and I escaped to Mount Augusta, taking refuge in the local LSIF commune.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The war ended a month and a half later, or rather, Columbia's war. Having been invited there in july by shadedoom, I accepted, leaving SATO behind. I decided to take over the old land, renaming it to Bohemia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A few friends of mine and I have drawn up some plans, however little actual development has occurred. Norfolk lies in ruins, picked away at by scavengers, however the land is used for farming frequently.</div></div>
