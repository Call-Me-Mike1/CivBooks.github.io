<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">the fact still remained that the Empire's forces outnumbered the motley militia that Balkania could muster so severely that each Balkanian could slay 25 Senntistenites on his own and still the small unit would still be swarmed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 47</a><div class="page-content">With that in mind, the Balkanians, including the Proud King himself, came into this field with the question not of if they lose, but when.

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 47</a><div class="page-content">King Spongesuds swore to himself as he reveled in the images conjured as he stood on the field on this frosty morning. And so, the King and his men stood firm as the advancing cohorts of the Senntistenites came ever closer to their modest rank.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 47</a><div class="page-content">No one lost their nerve; all were willing to give their lives to the pledge they made upon the majestic colors of red, blue and white, to their nation and to their King, who now stood in front of them, having offered himself to be the first</div></div>

Nevertheless, all the men stood their ground as the lone banner that fluttered in the wind as the standard stood steadfast well into their rank,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 47</a><div class="page-content">as if the men had the unspoken agreement that their noble flag should be the last to fall. For Balkania did not truly fall until the last flag was ripped from its pole and the last dream was ripped by the untimely death of the last dreamer.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 47</a><div class="page-content">against those that intended to shatter it. By making claims, drawing imaginary lines and coloring in portions of landmasses on a map, the behemoth of an Empire took the first step in crushing this dream but laying de jure claim on the entire land</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 47</a><div class="page-content">that the Balkanians had found empty and barren, inviting them to come to their new home and build their nation. The next steps were then taken, from the international pressure, to the light harassment, to the threats,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 47</a><div class="page-content">and even to the Rape that is seared into the collective consciousness of the Balkanian nation, the dream was slowly chipped away at.

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">But the dreamer does not take kindly to having his dream deprived from him, and so this brave collection of dreamers stand stalwart and ready to defend their dream. Regiments to both their flanks, and regiments directly ahead of them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They had enough men to encircle the Balkanian position easily, and by the rate of their advance they could do it quickly. This threat of being caught in a pincer scared no one, as they all stood resolute and kept their ordered positions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Finally, the trumpets were sounded, signalling that mighty Senntisten was to finally begin her assault. Her armies' slow march quickened its pace and an attack was imminent. The King looked back at his men, being greeted by a wave of determined faces.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Their faces told all. They were ready to fight, and they were ready to die. No words were needed. And accordingly, the King looked back at the charging horde, raised his royal sword up high and simply let out a defiant yawp,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 47</a><div class="page-content">which signalled to the troops that they were to charge against the horde that opposed them. And with battlecries that would inspire Mars himself, the Balkanian army charged right into the bosom of the enemy unit, arms in hand and ready to use them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 47</a><div class="page-content">They broke into a full sprint, intent on unleashing the utmost berserker fury that they could muster against the invaders, who were now running against them and screaming aggressive yells of their own.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The King led the charge, running straight into Senntisten's lines. Contact between the two armies would come in mere seconds. And come it did, in a spectacular clash that made the earth rumble with its auditory volume</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 47</a><div class="page-content">and even sent men flying several feet into the air and knocked into the ground, for the momentum was so great that it almost matched the fury of the Balkanians. King Sponge wasted no time in putting his enemies to the sword.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Left and right, he hacked and slashed, often landing killing blows in the chinks of the Senntistenites' admittedly superior armor, and those he simply sent to the ground would be finished with a strike from one of the men right behind him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 47</a><div class="page-content">In the chaos of it all, the screams could be heard in an instant as blood squirted out everywhere, often landing in one's face, eyes, and if he was unlucky enough to have his mouth agape, unto his tongue where he would feel the bitter taste</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 47</a><div class="page-content">of the death of a human being. But the fighting continued, and the slaughter's pace only picked up from the initial clash. Limbs were flying, blood curdling screams struck terror to all who were unfortunate enough to hear them,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 47</a><div class="page-content">and all the men who were walking on this blood-drenched field felt they were stepping in a marsh, only to look down and discover that they treaded not upon bog water and thick roots of trees,</div></div>
