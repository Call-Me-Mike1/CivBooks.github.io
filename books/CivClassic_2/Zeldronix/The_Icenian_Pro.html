      By Zeldronix

      Introduction

   The following is a      collection of facts
 and observations of
  our neighbour and  opinions collected and   surveyed from the  truidencian populace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 1 "A Threat"

As we all know icenia is a power that borders us on all sides by sea or river and in some instances land. It is by land their existence as a threat to truidencian soverignty is best seen. And I assure you, that threat is very real.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">On the doorstep of our capitol, the Rubicon-Dol Morhen border, there has been sightings of work being done for the demolition of Old Carbon by Icenia.  

When inquired about this I was responded with that there was a wish to expand their farms in that area.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Naturally I did not believe these lies, for who in their right mind would build farms on a border between nations? 
No, there has to be another reason.

It is my belief that they are building something there they they wish to keep secret.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A wild claim I know. But
look at the facts.
 
The icenians have proven themselves to be truely barbarous with no respect for the truidencian people
or even the sovereignty of our great nation time and time again. 
They even kill our own in our very capitol.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">There has been a sudden appearance of a railway in Rubicon seemingly out of
nowhere.

That combined with the rapid colonization of Nexton (formerly Carbonia) threatening our southern shores.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The north of rubicon was cleared of ruins months ago yet the south is still littered with looted ruins of Carbon. Why? Why would they only clear the land that is bordering ours? A mystery.. It makes it all the more intriguing that they have left the land barren with the railroad being the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">only exeption. Perhaps they have built underground? In that case What? They haven't even built any of their supposedly planned farms!

There has to be an answer to all this. One that they would not give up freely.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2 "An insult"

  As a nation with an
 undying love for our
  lord and saviour 
          Bez 
   Emperor eternal,
 God above all else,  Deity of the true faith,

It is an insult to The Empire itself if our faith is insulted. Nay it is an insult directed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">to the very heart of every believer of the true faith, a heart that sings the music of life that is Bez 
OH GLORY BE ONTO BEZ oh for what have we done to deserve such love? He lights up the sky each day at sunrise and darkens the clouds when its time to rain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The heathens have soiled the steps to heaven, they vandalize his temples and even their leader spits upon our faith. Let it be known that their crimes will not go unpunished, for they are numerous. 
They corrupt and destroy all that is sacred in their path to domination.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">They are faithless.
They steal.
They corrupt.
They slaughter.
They lie.
They cheat.
And will do everything they can to undermind those who in truth are superior.

Those few of them who as accepted Bez into their hearts have fled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">the oppression of their former countrymen. 
We must try to understand the
heathen if we are to defeat him. To convert a godless people will be difficult. There will be those who resist the word of Bez. Even within our own ranks there are traitors waiting to be exposed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">For it is a punishment, a punishment that has been placed upon us by our lord, for we have let the shoots of evil to spring up in the soil that which we have plowed. We must root all such out in this time of peril. Heathens are only the start of our problems. For there are those who betray Bez.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It is spreading, the lies of Beretism and Jahism. The unpure must be cleansed and the corrupted must be swept away. The blasphemer must be exposed for that they really are, traitors, traitors and heretics. Why would you question the will of Bez? For your life is his possession.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It is our holy task to rid this world of evil and purify his realm for his return. 
He WILL return to reign again and all those who doubted will burn but in horrible agony forever! Forever and ever! The flame sears! It rends you with such pains as you have never known!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">That is the doom in store for all who are denied grace. The witch, the traitor, the scoffer of the true religion, the speaker of blasphemous oaths, they who plays the shitter, and they who plays the newfriend pearler be warned!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3 "A Saviour"          _  ____ _
