<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Flying is the action of being sustained above the ground without falling.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The Art of Flying<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There is an art to flying, or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, that presents the difficulties.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A Lesson in Flying<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>How to Fly<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Getting Started<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You must learn how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day and try it. The first part is easy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">All it requires is the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">If you are really trying properly, the likelyhood is that you will fail to miss the ground fairly hard.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else then you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination), or a bomb going off in your vicinity,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above the ground in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is the moment for superb and delicate concentration.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Bob and float. Float and bob.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">They are most likely to say something along the lines of "Good God, man, you can't possibly be flying!" It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops, breathing regularly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Landing<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>With more experience, you will learn how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly screw up, and screw up badly, on your first attempt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Flight School<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There are private flying clubs you can join which help you with the all important moment of distraction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.</div></div>
