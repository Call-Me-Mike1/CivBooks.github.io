Day 0
Tommorow I set out on my travels to the north, I have gathered up all the supplies I need.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Day 1
The sun has begun to rise, and now I will set off from my home in Riskia island.
I am now sailing across the bay of Mila to Arem, where I will walk along the road north to the Cape of Mila.
I now set off from the north coast of Mila to unknown lands to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">north. The first of these is the Provincia Oblast, which is part part of the CCCP. Provincia Oblast was once a fairly prosperous nation known as the United Provinces of the Plus Plus, which was later shortened to Provincia. It later collapsed into inactivity, and agreed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">to join the CCCP, likely to keep the cities safe. While sailing across the sea, a thunderstorm occured, and I have come upon a strange structure which appears to be a rubix cube or something made of various types of rocks. It's a little ominous so I'm going to keep going.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I have reached the straits of Provincia, both sides are flanked with high walls of stained clay. On the left side there is a decent port with a cool boat in it. A ways into the canal I saw what appeared to be a floating shard of stone brick, which is a bit unsettling. A bit after that is a fine</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">birch bridge spanning the divide between the two islands.
Day 2
After a full night of sailing I came out of the other side of the strait, into another sea. After sailing north for a while through the rain, I saw an island with high stone cliffs. It has dark oak trees</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">growing off of the side of it like mushrooms. According to a sign on a beach it was part of Provincia at some time in the past. I believe now that I am near the southern coast of Vuoto, which is a nation that I do not know anything about, except that it is south of Lambat, one of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">places that I am hoping to visit. I'm now sailing west and then north to hopefully find a dock so I can walk for a bit cause sailing is boring. It is night now, and I have sailed up to the coast of central Vuoto, and it looks like they have alot of weird pine and jungle trees. I have now cross into -,-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">It is now night, and I decided against visiting Vacari since I saw some lava on the roof of a house which is kind of a red flag. I saw a bee buzzing by on the river which is a sign of good luck. Near northern Salakot I have passed by a smallish settlement of houses built on the water.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Day 3
I have rounded the cape of Salakot and I've seen some Dolphins, and I'm on my way to the old Georgian lands in what was once the land of Aznazia. Sidenote, Aznazia is kind of a weird name cause it sounds like Nazi. I have landed on the coast of Old Georgia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">When I came upon where the village here once stood, it was in a deplorable state, everything is greifed, and someone vomited dirt upon the place, and all of the buildings are gone. (It clearly had NPC villager houses based on the fact that there is the foundations of old NPC Village farms.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I am now at a stone port, which i assume was the actual capital of this island, it is slightly greifed. The main city is pretty nice aside from some minor greif, also I noticed there's still alot of stuff there, and someone left a dog behind. In a tower I found a brewery, but to my horrer I saw</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">that some braindead idiot smashed every barrel. I left the city center and found a weird stone brick thing with red window panes. The building has three skulls on the front, and a scary room in the basement. After findin another way into it, I am now descending down a strange</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">obsidian shaft. It led into a mineshaft. (the generated structure, but also some civ-made tunnels too) It has snitches in it, which is weird for a mineshaft. I've been following the line of snitches, and going deeper into the mine, as with other forgotten places in the roots of the world</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">one tends to get a sense of unease, as if being watched. The shaft opened into a cave, which has water from the ocean above pouring into it, which I will swim up, as the tunnel weirdly does not go any further. I am now back up at the wooden port, and it appears that a day has passed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Day 4
I am now investigating a weird dirt tower, which has an obsidian base that likely contained an elevator in better times. I reached the top, and it seems to be an old watchtower, likely built by Aznazia. The north of the island is just wilderness and a single beetroot farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Day 5
I am tired of travelling for the time being, so I'm going to go to Lambat City, and take a train home. (It's one of the places I was wanting to visit anyways)
