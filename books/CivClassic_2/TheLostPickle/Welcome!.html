First off, welcome to my humble home. It is not often that I get visitors, be that a blessing or a curse, it makes the moments when I do all the more exciting. I understand that you are interested in building a Roman style city, however I have always loved the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Arabic style, so that is what I am and will be using. I do understand; however, that you are also interested in perhaps helping me build this wonderful land. I know it can be daunting coming to a new place with no information, so here's the rundown
. 
Building style: Well as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">you know, this is an Arabic city, however more specifically we are using andyisyoda's Desert 5x5 building style, which he has about 4 videos on. I adhere to this system very strictly, because I feel like having a uniform building style is very important to building a community</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">and a culture. Just search up andisyoda desert to see how it works. It makes building so much easier.
Ownership: This land is owned by the Maritime Republic of Capeland. I have their full permission and support in the construction of my city, they are active</div></div>

Short term: In the shorterm I want to build maybe 5-6 buildings and a small bazaar, I expect this to take about a month.
Long term: Building wise I want to construct a temple and have a vibrant city, as well as a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">palace. My vision is ultimately to either gain independence or some level of autonomy within the Capeland system. I want to set up a religion based around some sort of sheep god, and I want all priests to be sheep who have taken vows of silence, and then have people act as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">connections between them and the people. Politically I aim for the are to be ruled over by an Emir, who will take sort of a presidential, but not legislative role. Of course I envision myself in this position, but who wouldn't? I want it to sort of be a constitutional monarchy like 1700s</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Great Britain, with an Emir and a parliament or town council. I want the city to be walled, and I want to set up a harbor for trade.
Important coords: Sugarcane, 5171, 705
Wabbittown (Spruce and Factories), 5500, 900
Cape Cocoa (Capeland Capital), 3800, 600
All buildings are to be</div></div>
