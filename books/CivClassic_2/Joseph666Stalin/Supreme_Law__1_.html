<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Feudalism is now a term that carries connotations of privilege and oppression. It was indeed a system of unequal hereditary status. Yet it stood for a kind of justice, because no one was so high that his priviliges were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 44</a><div class="page-content">not conditional upon the discharge of obligations, and no one was so low that he was without certain rights. Although in practice it often fell short of this ideal, it was only when feudalism began to disintegrate, that privilege became wholly divorced</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 44</a><div class="page-content">from obligation. So it is not simply a medieval kind of slavery, like many modern people would suggest.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------We are originally a tribe from the east, founded upon the mountainous peninsula to the north of Caledonia, later vassalized by Sovia while still belonging to their nobility. We trade primarily with Caledonia and Sovia,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Our King is a Christian and so is this Kingdom, as of now no degenerates have been involved with the fate of our tribe.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------The desires that bring people to cults — including the need to feel secure and protected — are universal human longings (as we would say, human givens). Cults form and thrive,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 44</a><div class="page-content">not because people are crazy, but because they have two kinds of wishes.  They want a meaningful life, to serve God or humanity; and they want to be taken care of, to feel protected and secure, to find a home. Cults are a mirror in which we can see,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 44</a><div class="page-content">more clearly focused, aspects of the wider culture — the process by which the norms, values, ideas and shared perceptions of a society are passed down from generation to generation. In conforming we become 'cultured'. There are practical advantages</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 44</a><div class="page-content">in conforming and certain disadvantages in not doing so.  No group or country is one static culture but a special mix of interrelating lesser cultures. The streetwise homeless in Britain today, for example, have a different 'culture'</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 44</a><div class="page-content">from a British farmer, accountant or a nurse.  At the same time, however, all British people share in something that is distinctive and different from, say, a South American, African or Middle Eastern culture. In other words, each country's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 44</a><div class="page-content">mix has a distinct 'flavour'. Most of us probably think that, unlike members of cults, we think for ourselves and act on our own volition.  This is in fact far from the case. Not only does much of our behaviour derive from (post hypnotic) conditioning,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 44</a><div class="page-content">but as social beings we easily become subject to automatic group behaviour. Group behaviour pattern is established very early on — in the family.  We comply with the way the family operates because, to survive, we have to. Our parents are our first</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 44</a><div class="page-content">'leaders'. We compete with our siblings within the family groups, exhibiting jealousies and rivalries. When we grow up, we become independent in some ways, but, unless we are weaned from it, the primitive pattern remains, largely unperceived.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 44</a><div class="page-content">As adults, much more than we usually realise, we still depend on leaders — parent figures — to look after us and take decisions. This basic pattern of group behaviour is found all round the world – in many other animals as well as us— and it arose out of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 44</a><div class="page-content">of the survival value of living in packs and herds. Survival chances were much higher as a member of a group that could act collectively for protection. So ‘don't be an outsider' is an instruction from our genes and that’s why, whatever environment</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 44</a><div class="page-content">we find ourselves in, we learn what behaviour is expected of us by imitating others and adhere to this approach most of the time. The enormous power of the group is evidenced in the fact that, if we witness a mugging or attack in the streets,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 44</a><div class="page-content">we are more likely to help if we witness it alone rather than in a crowd or group.  Many studies have shown this. It happens because, if others are around, we look to others for cues on how to behave. But there are clearly times when this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 44</a><div class="page-content">is inappropriate behaviour and leadership is sought.  Leaders are people who can detach themselves enough from the group to be able to make choices based on their individual judgement. They then can point the way. To get everyone going,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 44</a><div class="page-content">they have to utilize group behavior. Their motivation for doing this may be selfish, altruistic or a mixture of both. Individuals may benefit from group protection when they join a cult — and there is evidence that many people are 'saner', safer</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 44</a><div class="page-content">and cause society fewer problems. In a group no one wants to be seen as the 'bad guy' who engages in degenerate behavior, causing great harm and creating divisiveness left and right. Cultured or 'civilized' behavior, wherever it is found,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 44</a><div class="page-content">procures a prosperous society, bonding people together through stimulating group activities and propelling the perfecting of the arts and the natural sciences, activating the efforts of the brightest of individuals.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 44</a><div class="page-content">These are all reasons why we, the Frankish people, have certain rites at certain times, are generous with our focus on the well-being of the group as a whole and discriminate against degenerate activities. There are no reasons not to.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 44</a><div class="page-content">Leaders demand loyalty and suppress criticism. For them, power must be a priority. Authority takes precendence over most things. Expertise, ancient wisdom and divine guidance have to be the sole reasons as to how they established themselves as superiors.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 44</a><div class="page-content">Therefore it is written that any king, duke, barons and any administrator has to be dignified according to their privileged positions, yet they are also demanded to act responsible for the prosperity of their counties and to guide their inferiors through</div></div>

Peasants have to obey them as they are representatives of the supreme law and appointed to judge each of their subordinates and to lead them to clarity and benevolent effort.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 44</a><div class="page-content">Such respect for leaders developed out of a natural process that began in the family and the tribe.  A child is more likely to die if it does not obey its parents who are more aware of dangers in the environment than the young one.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 44</a><div class="page-content">As people grow up and the society they live in becomes more complex, individuals with expertise had to give direction and be followed and obeyed in certain circumstances.
