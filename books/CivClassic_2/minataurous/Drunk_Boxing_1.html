          Rules

<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 1: Set Up

    Before your first match of drunken boxing, you must brew a couple drinks. They can be any brew you want depending on what kind of match(one with a lot of buffs or debuffs) you want to fight in. The drinks can also be of any quality. If you want a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">match with a lot of debuffs I would recommend vodka (2 star if you are feeling extra brave). If you want a match with some buffs, I would recommend golden mead.
    The next thing you need before your first match is an arena. The arena can be any size, but it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 23</a><div class="page-content">must be flat and have some sort of border around it(preferably made of fences) to prevent the fighters from getting out. 
    You don't want your arena to be too large, otherwise the matches may take too long and contain too much running. You don't want the arena to be too small or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content">your fights may be uninteresting. The original arena in Snowpeak is a 5 by 6 platform with fences on the outer blocks, leaving an area inside of slightly more than 3 by 4 blocks. I have found this to be a good size.
    You now have everything you need to start. Have each of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 23</a><div class="page-content">your fighters stand in a corner of your arena (traditional matches have two fighters, but there can be more) and give them each a bottle of achohol. As stated previously, it doesn't matter which drink it is, as long as you give everyone the same drink and they are all the same quality. Make</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 23</a><div class="page-content">sure all fighters have emptied their inventory and have been given their achohol and you are ready to fight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2: Playing

    Once every fighter has their alchohol, count down from three and say go. Once you say go, all fighters start drinking. As soon as you finish your drink, you are allowed to start attacking your opponent. You may not move until you have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 23</a><div class="page-content">finished your drink.
    You win when your opponent dies or taps out. You can tap out at any time, but it is a good idea to do so when you are at half a heart. Dying is a hassle and you don't want to have to explain in chat that you weren't in a real fight, but instead just boxing. When someone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 23</a><div class="page-content">taps out, you are required to stop hitting them. If you accidentally continue and kill them, there is no consequence, but purposefully attacking them after they tap will hand the win over to the opponent. 
    For matches of more than two fighters, when someone taps,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">everyone stops moving and that person leaves the arena. Once that person leaves, you count down from 3 and continue fighting. You win a match with more than 2 fighters when you are the only fighter left in the arena.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3: Spectators

    Spectators can be a very fun part of drunken boxing. In my experience, fights are always better when people are watching. Just make sure that your spectators do not influence the fight in any way.
    Spectators are not allowed to punch</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 23</a><div class="page-content">fighters, enter the arena, or put any blocks or entities inside the arena. It is up to the fighters, referee (if you have one) and other spectators to keep fights fair and fun. 
    Gambling is both allowed and encouraged. You can set up your own system for gambling</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">or just let the spectators gamble among themselves, but you are not allowed to prevent gambling (unless a person has a gambling addiction). In a similar vein, drinking among the spectators is also allowed, but it might not be a good idea, as the blindness that comes from drinking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 23</a><div class="page-content">could prevent them from seeing the fight.</div></div>

         Part  2:



         History




>>---------------<<</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4: Origins

    Drunken boxing originated in the town of Snowpeak, Icenia. The four founders of the town had built a brewery and were learning the basics of making drinks. Because they were learning, they made a lot of low quality drinks. They were left with a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 23</a><div class="page-content">problem: No one wants to buy low quality drinks. So they had a ton of low quality drinks to get rid of, but nothing to do with them. The solution: drunken boxing. They started holding fights and tournaments. Eventually we enjoyed it enough to make it the official sport of the town. I (one of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 23</a><div class="page-content">founders) have decided to share this sport so that others may enjoy it as much as I have.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 5: Now/Future

    At the time of writing, the sport is about two weeks old. I write this book to hopefully expand the sport's popularity. It is hard to predict the future of the sport because the future is uncertain, and we are all still drunk from all the drunken boxing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I intend to write a second book in this "drunken boxing series". That book will be a strategy guide, containing all the knowledge of the sport the other founders of Snowpeak and I have gained from the fights we have done. Until then, thank you for reading and happy fighting!</div></div>
