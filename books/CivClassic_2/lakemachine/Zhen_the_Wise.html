<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Many religions have come and gone in this world of ours. From the worship of Kek to the many mystery cults in this World, you can find a large number of players following a creed or dismissing it all as superstition. This book is a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 46</a><div class="page-content">translation of a rare archaeological find - several rare tablets intact, telling us the story of a man who pondered and became like a god, and the men after him who became gods after him. It is a creation story, and despite its ancient age it still shows</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 46</a><div class="page-content">signs of bright, ancient minds figuring out the world around them the only way they knew how. This religion never had a name and has no active followers, but inside these tablets we can gain a glimpse of a time when our ancestors thought much differently</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 46</a><div class="page-content">but still much alike. This is a story of kindness, ruthless ambition, and the depravity and corruptibility of the human condition, written thousands of years before most of our nihilistic bull we read today. This is the story of The Pondering Man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 46</a><div class="page-content">1. Long ago, the universe was tangled into chaos.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2. The Universe sighed and weeped, for it had no form and no beauty.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3. The Strings of the Universe were frayed and cracked, and were ghastly to the eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 46</a><div class="page-content">4. The Sun saw the Universe as she cried, and the Sun comforted her.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>5. The Sun took the Warmth in his soul and took the cruel, ugly Strings of the Universe, and fused them into a being of both unconditional love and cold cruelty.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 46</a><div class="page-content">6. The Souls of the Universe and the Sun left the Universe and the Sun, leaving behind nothing but crude strings with no life.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>7. The Fusion of these souls created the Master Manipulator, the first Man who could see and manipulate the Strings in our</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>9. He created vast, great machines with the strings of the Universe.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>10. The Master Manipulator created</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 46</a><div class="page-content">cold, shimmering stars that live far away and dance to remind us of the Universe's beauty.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>11. The Master Manipulator created the sad, cold, lifeless moon to be a partner to the lifeless sun which once had been the home of one of his two souls.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 46</a><div class="page-content">12. The Master Manipulator saw the moon he had created, and the stars he had created, yet he cried out, "I am alone, for there are only two souls in this Universe, and they are within me!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>13. The Master Manipulator needed a house for these</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>14. The warm soul in him from his Father the Sun wanted these souls to be happy, so he created grassy fields, beautiful rivers, and delicious fruits for the souls to nourish them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>15. The cold soul</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 46</a><div class="page-content">from his cold mother the Universe was angry with this, so the Master Manipulator scorched some of these grassy fields, brought poison from some of these fruits, and brought devastating floods from these beautiful rivers.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>17: "Stop! For my souls have battled long enough.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 46</a><div class="page-content">22. The souls within him agreed to cease their fighting, while the Master Manipulator finally rested.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>23. After a thousand years of resting, the Master Manipulator was ready to create fellow souls to help ease his loneliness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 46</a><div class="page-content">24. The Master Manipulator mainpulated the strings of the universe to form a small, insignificant, mechanical being without a soul that dwelled in the water.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>25. This soulless being multiplied and became the fish that we know and eat today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 46</a><div class="page-content">26. The Master Manipulator weeped, for his being had no soul and he was desparately alone.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>27. He manipulated the Strings until he created a soulless being in the air.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>28. This being multiplied until it became the birds we know today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 46</a><div class="page-content">29. The Master Manipulator tried manipulating a soul into existence again and again, but never did a soul come into being.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>30. The Earth was populated by creatures that multiplied and ate but never dared to ponder, as only souls can ponder.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 46</a><div class="page-content">31. The Master Manipulator finally realised that the only souls in the universe were his. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>32. He asked them, "How may other souls ever come into this lonely, bleak universe? Why do you two souls exist yet no other souls?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 46</a><div class="page-content">33. His souls said unto him, "We are the wellspring set up by the Weaver of the Strings by which other souls like yours may be created.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>34. The Master Manipulator was shocked by their response, as he had only thought himself to have two souls,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 46</a><div class="page-content">but he had a third one that the two souls of the Universe and Sun gave birth to. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>35. "We have waited too long to have another child. Please, arrange these strings into a worthy vessel, so that we might have more children than just you,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>36. The Master Manipulator's soul agreed to let the other two souls in him mate thousands of times inside him, so that thousands of other souls might inhabit these vessels that he would create.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>37. While the Master</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Manipulator's parent souls mated within him, he created a vessel. This vessel was weak and pathetic, yet the Master Manipulator knew that these souls would seek each other out and band together against the threats of the half-cruel World.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 46</a><div class="page-content">38. The Master Manipulator gathered thousands of these vessels, and said to his cold mother and warm father, "let me give birth to the souls within me, so that they may fill these weak vessels I have created for them."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>39. But his two souls cried out,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 46</a><div class="page-content">saying "Are these the grand vessels which you have created for our children? All the strings, and all the time in your Mother Universe, but these weak, flawed vessels with enormous heads?" Give us a more worthy vessel, one with the subtley of a panther,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 46</a><div class="page-content">the strength of an auroch, and the bravery of a Hippopotamus."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>40. But the Master Manipulator said to his parents, "If these souls have too much power over the world around them, they would become arrogant and solitary, letting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 46</a><div class="page-content">the cold, evil part of them take over their hearts."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>41. "Therefore, let these souls be in weak, cursed vessels, so that they may learn to live and rely one another, so that the warm, kind part may balance out the cold and still survive against the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 46</a><div class="page-content">other creations."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>42. The Souls of the Universe and the Sun were greatly moved by this talk, and agreed to release their children into these vessels.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>43. These vessels awoke, and with the elements and the creations</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 46</a><div class="page-content">of the world against them, they learned how to survive in this world. They learned how to farm, how to create pottery to store items, and to create art celebrating the warmth and love in life and mourn the darkness and cruelty in life as well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 46</a><div class="page-content">44. These vessels were the first people, and all humans are descendants of the first vessels that the Master Manipulator created and the warm sun and cruel Universe filled with life. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>45. The Master Manipulator rested for thousands of years,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 46</a><div class="page-content">as giving birth to so many souls had taken up much of his energy. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>46. The Souls of the Universe and Sun wanted to return to their original places in the cosmos.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>47. They begged to the Master manipulator, saying,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 46</a><div class="page-content">48. "We have lived so long in your body, being a part of you. Please, let us return to our original place in the Universe, so that we may rule with you over the souls and the cosmos."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>49. The Master Manipulator's cold side made him greedy for the power</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 46</a><div class="page-content">he did have, and the warm side of him feared what the Universe could wreak on itself once it had control of its strings once again. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>50. The Master Manipulator said to his souls, "Cease your fighting! For my soul is balanced and can rule</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 46</a><div class="page-content">this grand Universe with a balance of cruelty and warmth that it needs!

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>51. Yet the Souls of his mother and father did</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 46</a><div class="page-content">not cease their fighting. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>52. The Master Manipulator finally gave them forms of their own, and placed them seven planes above the physical plane of man.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>53. Yet the two souls cursed, and vowed to get revenge, yet the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Master Manipulator let them remain in their weakened forms.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>54. He said unto them,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I am tired of your unceasing fighting against me and against each other! If you need power, have it, but do not think you can challenge my power!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 46</a><div class="page-content">55. "For you created me to be the Supreme Manipulator of the Universe, so I shall be that! Your decisions lead to your downfall, foolish Mother! Foolish Father!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>56. "Therefore, both of you shall be granted equal power on the seventh plane of existence,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>57. The Soul of the Universe became the Manipulator of Chaos, and the Soul of the Sun became the Manipulator of Fortune.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>58. These two Manipulators</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 46</a><div class="page-content">indeed did war over the fate of their children's souls, and continue to do so to this day. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>59. At times, the Manipulator of Chaos wins a battle and we get droughts, wars, and famine.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
