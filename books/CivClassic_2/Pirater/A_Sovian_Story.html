<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I arose from a deep slumber in the middle of a night, atop a great mountain located near the beautiful orange mesa, where I made first contact with another human being.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>From a cocoon of dazzling light, I arose - and everybody knew of my presence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Several nations began trying to make first contact, although only one succeeded. I roamed for hours through the desolate mesa, desperately searching for hints of a civilization.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I stumbled constantly, starving with an unquenchable thirst.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The world was cruel and sadistic, constantly punishing me for my mistakes. I roamed until I heard a voice. That voice was Parker. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Parker found me in a state of delirium induced by dehydration and food. He allowed me to take some bread.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Considering I had nowhere to live, I decided to join the beautiful town of Vegas. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Vegas didn't have as many people as some cities, but we had a great community. It was part of Oxeye at large.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">At this point, Vegas didn't have several cities as it did later on (including my own city of Skyland, and Magmus' incredible underground city Raldbthar).<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Oxeye had some of my favourite people from Civ, such as Wergo, Vecticus and Parker, and was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">one of my favourite places to stay. I inhabited the city as a newfriend, built a basic house.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Things were soon to change, as I did tasks for Wergo. I liked to do things such as mining to make a living, and eventually I would find my first introduction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to the politics on this server. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I embarked on a voyage, through the nether, an expedient way to make it to the edge of the world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There, Wergo took me to Vicccyy and we started digging a vault. It was fun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I got to see a really cool vault, and it turns out their nation was called the Pirates which is pretty epic, because I'm called Pirater.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I decided I would try to help them through the server, since they helped me out as a new player and taught me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">about how the server works. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Eventually, I finished the vault and left, remaining in touch with the Pirates who would be a great ally for the rest of the server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I decided to make something of myself, so I opened a brewery</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in Njordomir and Torynado's town of Red Sand. It was a small, but honest brewery - and I worked hard to discover recipes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I discovered tea, coffee, vodka and many more recipes. I became one of the most established brewers ever.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">My success as a brewer was short lived, as I was about to enter a major conflict.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>While I would not be a major fighter in the first war of Piracy, I would do things such as mining to help the Pirates. While I was fairly neutral, and friendly with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">both sides, I supported the Pirates most. Wergo was ambushed and pearled at an event, and we had to save Wergo.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>My first PvP experience was breaking bastions at the vault. They didn't want me fighting, but ironically when they</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Somewhere inside all of these events, I was in my brewery when some newfriends announced a nation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">They were very optimistic, and speaking about how great their nation was, so I decidied to help them out. After I got one to travel 8000 blocks to deliver me seeds, I followed him back.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I decided to join and help them with their nation. These were early</div></div>

I was not yet leader, as the leaders were Laikalike and Henry_VIII, but as Sovia rose in popularity, so did I...<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Amongst Sovians, I was an unusual figure. As someone who had already amassed wealth,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">it was strange that I would be in this fairly poor new city. I had built myself a castle house, and soon Sovia had communal housing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We rapidly grew in population, reaching a peak of around 20 active players, which was very impressive for Devoted 2.0!</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Sovia grew so quick, the current leaders struggled to cope with the growth, so we made the fatal decision to split into 5 nations, with philosophies as diverse as feudalism and communism.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>With the backing of Oxeye and the Pirates, I established Skyland.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Skyland was an incredible place, which was incredibly peaceful. The few inhabitants were myself, Tomw9981, inhabitants of the Oxeye Embassy and tabbynya (R.I.P)<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, my foreign involvement started growing. I illegaly began to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">snitch other people's lands, and I began to do espionage in other ex-Sovian nations.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One day, after I returned from a Pirate vault break to help save Wergo, the final straw had been broke.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At the vault break, I was jumping around</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I fell into a cobweb, and Reiko was going around me for a long time. Eventually, for some reason, I was given</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Sovians said to me, "You can't use Reiko as a pokemon!", and tension gathered in the capital.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>People from all Sovian states were online,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Things were about to get serious. I wanted to use Reiko as a pokemon, but they didn't let me. Then when they mentioned that it's unfair, I pearled them all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I began killing Sovians in a massacre, the remaining ones who survived Brigand's attack on the city which happened earlier that week.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is due to the fact they tried to apprehened me for having Reiko's pearl, even though Reiko</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Most Sovians began to leave, making the city only myself and a few friends. Reuniting Sovia made me leader. I freed Reiko, having nowhere to store his</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As leader of Sovia, we had a huge city and decided to mine, amassing over half a chest of diamonds - not bad for a few people. We began to participate more in Civ politics, making alliances with other nations.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">several weeks. Eventually, since they considered me a Pirate anyway, I decided to flee to Pirate Bay, their capital and build a nice house.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Pirate Bay was a nice city, and we had lots of cool people. Vicccyy helped me build my house, and</div></div>
