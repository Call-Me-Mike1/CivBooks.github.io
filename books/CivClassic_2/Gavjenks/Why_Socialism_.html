<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is the question. If you want an answer to the question, you need only keep reading! If you are against racism, keep reading! If you are for always having enough for everyone, keep reading!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Humans are social animals. We do not exist alone! We are just as human as everyone else, no more, no less. Capitalists often promise "Liberty" or "Freedom" as part of their systems. But what does this concept of "Freedom" really mean?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Capitalism dumps you onto a playing field which is not level. Suppose you are running a marathon. Lots of people are running in this marathon, except you are forced to carry a heavy weight with you, and some people are allowed to ride bikes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">That doesn't sound like a very fair race, does it? Of course not. It's not fair at all. Do you feel very "free" while carrying that weight along with you, watching some people sail on past you? Probably not. But such is capitalist "freedom!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">In capitalism, you must, at the heart of it, fend for yourself.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But what if it didn't have to be this nasty? What if you everyone was treated equally? What if we didn't have minorities stuck in poverty?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">What if people always got the medical care they needed, always had a place to live? What if people worked together?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Sounds great, doesn't it? After all, we learn from an early age that things like sharing, fairness and friendship are good!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">And yet capitalism provides us neither with fairness nor sharing! Doesn't seem very nice, does it?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But what if it wasn't this way? What if we had a system where the answer to all these questions was an emphatic "Yes?"</div></div>
