<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He expressed his desire to speak with his Leader, and to speak with him before-</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When his Leader came to him, The Raider said: "I want to whisper to you," and when the leader approached near him, he nearly pushed him off into the vault hole.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">All the citizens were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"It is to punish him," he said. "When I was a newfriend I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to my Leader.-</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>During a long travel across the map, there was a traveler who began to starve from the few thousands blocks he had covered.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Suddenly he came across a vast wheat field.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 27</a><div class="page-content">In front there was a sign that read, “Public use, please replant.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>“Perfect,” thought the nearly starved traveler, “What a kind farmer to plant food for everyone, and just in time.”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 27</a><div class="page-content">He took all of the wheat, and seeing no one was around decided he would not waste time replanting. So leaving the field barren he went off and arrived at his destination safely with plenty of food to spare.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Upon logging and seeing his field void of crop, the farmer checked his snitches and ran to the nearest town in which he also supplied food for to warn them of a crop thief.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As he arrived he saw the man who took without replanting.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 27</a><div class="page-content">He alerted the guards and they immediately pearled him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The farmer said to himself as he watched, “The time you saved, decidedly cost you more time than it takes to replant for others.”</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A member of Uguu and a Newfriend were travelling together, the man from Uguu prancing along in his fine prot and carrying only food and a fancy sword, the Newfriend in iron and gold mob armor trudging carrying stone and a pick.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 27</a><div class="page-content">"I wish I were you," sighed the Newfriend; "nothing to do and well geared, and all that fine armor upon you." <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Next day, however, there was a great battle, and the Uguu man was wounded to death in the final assault of the day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 27</a><div class="page-content">His old pal, the newfirend, happened to pass by shortly before he saw the Uguu man struck and pearled, sentenced to months of imprisonment. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I was wrong," said the newfriend: "Better humble security than gilded danger”</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A new Mt. Augustan citizen who fit in well and made many friends had tons of fun playing with them, yet grew jealous of all the wealth his fellow friends had.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 27</a><div class="page-content">At last he grew so tired and hopeless that it would take ages to accumulate this wealth, and cried out: <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I cannot bear this any longer. Ah, I will raid an unoccupied nation to become rich!"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He gained much wealth but did not realize-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 27</a><div class="page-content">this unoccupied land had been claimed by a powerful nation comprised of many fighters.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Upon noticing their valuables raided the powerful nation inquired that it was MTA who took their ores and diamonds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Whilst no one from MTA would fess up to something they did not do the new citizen was proud of his riches.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The powerful nation declared war on MTA-</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now, with nothing the lonely citizen slowly losing the will to play cried out, "My most valuable wealth was not in diamonds-</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Malen once went bounty hunting along with the Pride, Sovokat, and Parker.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They chased and chased till at last they surprised the raider, and soon pearled him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Then came the question how the bounty should be divided.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Divide it into fourths," proclaimed Malen; so the others ran to collect the bounty tossing it in four piles at Malens feet.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Malen stood above the loot and pronounced judgment:</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Humph," grumbled Pride as he walked away with a single tear rolling down his cheek; but he spoke in a low voice:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
