<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Here are the gifts. Take one, leave the others. And be wary, choose wisely; oh, choose wisely! for only one of them is valuable."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The gifts were five: Fame, Love, Riches,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"There is no need to consider"; and he chose Pleasure.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He went out into the world and sought out the pleasures that youth delights in. But each in its turn was short-lived and disappointing, vain and empty; and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">each, departing, mocked him. In the end he said: "These years I have wasted. If I could but choose again, I would choose wisely."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The man considered long, then chose Love; and did not mark the tears that rose in the fairy's eyes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After many, many years the man sat by a coffin, in an empty home. And he communed with himself, saying: "One by</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Years went by and she came again, and stood behind the man where he satsolitary in the fading day, thinking. And she knew his thought:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"My name filled the world, and its praises were on every tongue, and it</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Choose yet again." It was the fairy's voice. "Two gifts remain. And do not despair. In there beginning there was but one that was precious,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Wealth-which is power! How blind I was!" said the man. "Now, at last, life will be worth the living. I will spend, squander, dazzle. These mockers and despisers will crawl in the dirt before me, and I will feed my hungry heart with</div></div>
