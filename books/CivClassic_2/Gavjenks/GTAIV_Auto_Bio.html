<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was the first time I had played Civcraft. I opened up my copy of Minecraft, navigated to the "Add Server" section in multiplayer, typed in "<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>untamedears.com"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> as the IP, moved my mouse</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At first, I was hesitant. I didn't enjoy all of</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Yet, for reasons I still don't quite understand, I decided to try this one out.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As soon as I hit connect, the welcome "loading world" string popped up on the muddy background, the screen refreshed, and I was plopped down somewhere. In</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I turned around and eyed my surroundings, squinting and trying to make sense of what was around me. I was obviously in a bog or swamp biome, a new biome added in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 37</a><div class="page-content">1.2.5 update. I also saw, in the distance, the glint of a skeleton disappearing between the trees. Gathering myself, I understood I had to move out as soon as possible.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I started trotting, semi-blindly. I didn't know what direction I was going in, it</div></div>

It was strange, I thought, that the forest I found myself in was so preistine and untouched, but I thought it must be protected by the administrator as a "no-build" area and that the spawn was</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was also perplexed by the lack of chat spam. No one was talking in the text box, no messages asking for donations were popping up, no "read the rules" in a multi-coloured bold font, was appearing. I felt almost as if I was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 37</a><div class="page-content">in singleplayer, and for a moment, shivered at how <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>alone <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I felt.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Maybe I had caught the server during a low-traffic time? I pondered this possibility and decided to set aside this reality for the moment and instead focus on survival.</div></div>

Stretchingfar up into the sky, I could see the faintest hint of light, and I decided at once to climb the mountain and get to what I was sure was the spawn.

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 37</a><div class="page-content">instructions, and a warp zone to a build area, rife with food andother players", I thought, not understanding why it wasn't marked better in the world.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Dauntingly I jumped from ledge to ledge, until I reached the halfway point of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 37</a><div class="page-content">mountain, and turned around to face the forest from where I had come from. My view stretched far out into the night turning into the early dawn as the first hints of the sun whispered in from the East. I saw the floor of the valley crawling with mobs,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 37</a><div class="page-content">miniscule from the ledge. I noticed my hunger bar was already depleting from the effort of climbing such a mountain and I turned back around, determined to reach the summit before the sun broke fully.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 37</a><div class="page-content">I finally clambered up onto the top plateau, hungry and dishevelled, as the first rays of the majestic sun pierced the foggy dusk and projected themselves forwards, past me, illuminating the structure that rested upon the mountaintop. Finally achieving a</div></div>

I walked up to the front of the structure and a sign was planted atop the door, informing me that it's name was "Fort Saucy" and that it was abandoned. One measly torch rested beside the door. I hit the wooden</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 37</a><div class="page-content">door and stepped inside.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the interior was a dark room with a cobblestone floor and wooden walls. A crafting table and a furnace sat in one corner, and in the other was a chest and a bed. I made my way to the chest and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 37</a><div class="page-content">opened it, hoping for food, but inside was only some junk: A daisy, some seeds, and a slightly used shovel. Disappointed, I took the shovel and closed the chest.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I noticed, in the semi-obscurity, a ladder leading up to the roof of the small</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 37</a><div class="page-content">fort. I climbed up and through a small trapdoor fashioned in the roof and lifted myself up onto a rickety wooden roof. Marvelling at the early-morning scenery, I paused for a second and watchedthe mobs in the valley below take fire and eventually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 37</a><div class="page-content">disappear in a poof of smoke. However, a quick glance to my now low hunger meter told me I needed to get a move on. I knew I had to find food soon, or face the inevitable death, and behind a death in this server I didn't know what there was.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Permanent death? Penalties? A ban? I didn't want to know. I wasn't ready to know. Not yet, I had just started.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I quickly made my way back into the room downstairs and checked the furnace. To my bewilderment there was a pile of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 37</a><div class="page-content">sticks in the bottom and a piece of bread in the top! I didn't know how long the bread had been sitting there, or if the server had custom plugins to simulate food decay, but I decided I needed to take my chances, and quickly wolfed the bread down. With</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 37</a><div class="page-content">relief I saw that it had restored a few points of hunger.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was suddenly made aware of movement outside my house. I turned around from the furnace and heard a stumbling of legs on grass. What could this be? Maybe a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 37</a><div class="page-content">pig, or a cow, or some other peaceful mob come to deliver to me it's loot, or maybe a lone creeper, survivor of the genocide that comes each Minecraft morning? I knew not, but a sudden flash of nametag informed me that I might have been in the presence of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 37</a><div class="page-content">some company.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I slowly made my way to the door and peeked out. I nearly jumped in my chair when I saw a posse of diamond-armour wearing players, all with their swords drawn. One of them was pointing a bow at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 37</a><div class="page-content">me. I made a move to back into my house and close the door, and the arrow was shot, slicing off half of my health as it stabbed me through the shoulder.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I mashed my chat button and quickly wrote, in all caps, "HELP! I'M BEING</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 37</a><div class="page-content">ATTACKED!". The rest was a flurry of activity as I ran back into the room and clambered up the ladder, attempting to get to the roof. I had tunnel vision as I concentrated on getting up to the roof and escaping my attackers. I punched in every direction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 37</a><div class="page-content">as I was surrounded, yelling, screaming, and attempting to escape.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I stopped for a second and looked at the chat. It was besieged by messages of the different players of the group asking me to calm down. I was given apples and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 37</a><div class="page-content">cooked chickens, and an iron chestplate was handed to me by the posse. They explained to me that they were simply patrolling the area, their area, they told me proudly, and had seen a mysterious unknown player disappear into a building from far away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Then they revealed they were Spaniards, and, in their own language, we exchanged laughs and apologies.
