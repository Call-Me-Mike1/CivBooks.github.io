Maybe I'm expected to put in words of hope for us during this war. However I don't see much hope. I don't think we'll lose but I don't think we'll win either. I think this war will go on forever and we'll always have the fear of another raid. who knows.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The biggest problem is the PMC. We asked to join about a week ago but nothing came of it. which being honest put's us in a postion without a lot of friends. I mean some might point out and asked why did you leave the NWO then. Well under the NWO we couldn't declare war. So it kinda left us in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">tough spot. Maybe the CES will let us join them. Who knows we might just go isolationist and live in peace. I don't have much hopes as for now but maybe the light can shine through a bit and we can just get one of these bastards.

It's funny how bloof and Asu are acting. It almost seems that they want us to talk it out with Olympia and not pearl their ass. I don't care what it takes but as long as shitters are gone from the northeast then I know I did my job. Tbh as long as no new Nato</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">pops up and hurts innocent newfriends I'm fine with whatever. But the moment I find a group of raiders I don't think they should have mercy. I think that maybe Bloof has gone soft maybe Egi might be more right for acadia willing to do what needs to be done. sept 2/21</div></div>

I don't know what to think of New Ohio. Some part of me thinks their with Olympia. Maybe they are and their shaking hands and sharing loot from the nations they have raided. Who knows at this point. If their with them it's one more group to kill. Maybe we can all get along.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Part of me thinks that they gave up. They left the server to never be seen agained. I say we'll know at the end of the month. If none of them log in by then I think it's safe to say that they quit and that were safe. sept 3/21</div></div>

It's been a few days but I think were safe now with nothing to fear. I feel like they left the game. That or they were one night alts for trolling never to return. Whichever it may be I don't care their gone and I can be free again. I will soon move down to the plains and grow crops</div></div>

Who knows what riches it may bring us since we are without bots. The dam is also said to be started soon. Been sent back to help improve the capital. Being honest not much I can do. Maybe I'll open up a shop but not like I'll make money so I'll</div></div>

Not like I have much to sell with what's up here. Well I guess it's for the best if I come up with some names. Maybe New Nexton considering I do miss the old. Who know's maybe some more blugar names.

It seems to be over after a few day's. Maybe we are safe. We joined IT yesterday but who knows maybe we can live out in peace finally. Now the real work begins helping to restore the nation. Maybe I can settle down and just run my bar. However we never know.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Maybe they'll come back one day but we'll be ready. But till then looks like we can calm down and relax. Maybe we can finally try to focus on the important things.
