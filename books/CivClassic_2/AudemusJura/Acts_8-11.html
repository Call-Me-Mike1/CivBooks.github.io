[1] And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 99</a><div class="page-content">[11] And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
