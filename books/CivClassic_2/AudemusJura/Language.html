<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Language starts with the mind. The mind is an interesting part of the body, as it allows us to; for lack of a better term, exist. Without the mind we would be nothing, just a corpse of flesh and bone that flops around on the ground motionless. Why is that?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The answer is merely a simple conclusion, we are nothing. Our minds control who we are, what we are, and what we do so in theory, we are minds, or in Español, <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Somos mentes<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The mind; as stated before, leads us to language. Language is a human construct, first planted in us after God removed the common language humans at that time had at the Tower of Babel (Gen. 11:9). Without this incident, language would not be an item in our lives.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">If one was asked to name a few languages, English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin (Chinese), Japanese, etc. would come to mind most often. These languages are some of the most spoken, and most recognized around the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Specifically, English, Mandarin, and Spanish are the three most spoken languages in the world respectively. These three constitute the majority of human speaking in most developed regions, such as the Americas, Europe, and Eastern Asia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The language most Americans would pick up as a second language if they had an option would be Spanish, as it is the second most spoken language in the United States after English. On a side note, while English is the most spoken in the US, it is not the official language; rather, it is</div></div>

The two languages English is predominantly based on, except for some Spanish, French, and German, are Latin and Greek. These two languages constitute more complex words (Greek), and phrases or biological/medicinal nomenclature (Latin).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Latin was traditionally used as the common language during the Roman Empire, but it is now dead, as there are no recognized states that use it as their official language, except Malta. Latin is also learned for recreational or professional purposes, an example of the professional</div></div>

Greek; however, is still used today, with over 13 million people speaking the language. Greek is used in the United States and most Anglophonic countries as the language used to describe ideas, or more commonly, compound words. An</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">example of this is with the word <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>philosophy, philo-<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> steming from <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>philia<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>, meaning love, and <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>-sophy<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> steming from <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>sophia<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>, meaning wisdom; therefore, philosophy comes from the Greek word <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>philosophia<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>, meaning "love of wisdom".</div></div>
