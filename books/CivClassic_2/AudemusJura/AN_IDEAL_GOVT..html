<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The ideal government is something political theorists, philosophers, and average citizens have sought after for millennia, with three major ideologies being manufactured, these being liberalism, conservatism, and centrism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">      <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Liberalism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Liberalism is the idea that morality, laws, and primary beliefs are inherently a construct, and can be malleable to the beholder. This belief system is held by most of the world, with popularity reaching its fullest since the early 1990s.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">    <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Conservatism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Conservatism is the opposite of liberalism, with the belief that morality, laws, and primary beliefs are grounded and cannot be changed. This belief system is the second most popular, with popularity started to rise since the 1960-80s.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">       <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Centrism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Centrism is the middle ground between conservatism and liberalism, with the ultimate goal of being unbiased necessary to an ideal government. Secondly, centrism is one of the least popular belief systems, with it being hated by many others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">In order to properly create an ideal government, analyzation of the major types of governmental rule must be used. Two examples will be shown, democracy and totalitarianism. Firstly, the analyzation of democracy shall be employed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">      <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Democracy
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
Democracy is the most used governmental system in the world, with a majority of the world using it as the basis for government. Democracy can be divided into two major types, these being federalism and unitarism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Federalism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Federalism is a type of democracy where the state is divided into substates, such as provinces or states. This system also divides itself in twain, with cooperative and dual federalism. A mixture between the two can be used.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">A summary of these two types is needed. Cooperative federalism allows the national (also known as federal) and state governments to "cooperate" on issues the state government cannot handle on its own. Examples of this include healthcare, military, and education.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Secondly, dual federalism separates the national and state governments. This has been regarded as the true form of federalism. National law triumphs state law in most cases; however, if state nullification is legal, the state wields the right to "nullify" the federal law.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Unitarism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Unitarism is the opposite of federalism, with all power going towards the national government. This belief system is used throughout the European Union, albeit not being used by the EU itself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">    <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Totalitarianism

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Totalitarianism is the opposite of democracy, with power going to the govt. instead of the people. Totalitarianism also involves the government's control of absolutely everything in a person's life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">This is widely regarded as one of the worst govermental systems, as any form of personal freedom is warped to serving the government, instead of themselves.

Totalitarianism also employs Marxist-Leninist Communism to further destroy freedom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Now let us use these definitions to find the ideal government for specific populations. Totalitarianism will not be used, so only a democratic form of government shall be mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">       An Ideal                 Government 

  
      Population:  

          1-5


         Area:
     
    0-250 sq blks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 21</a><div class="page-content">This population and equal area would benefit from a government similar to a municipal or Mayor-Council government, with strong unitarism as dividing the country in districts would cause the divisions of power to grow, possibly leading to revolution from the states.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Population: 6-15
Area: 250-500 sq blk.

A unitary form of government would still be useful, with socialism being the most likely candidate for the economic system.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Population: 16-25
Area: 500-1000 sq blk.

If the area meets popular criteria, co-op federalism would be the best option, as dividing the whole Civ into districts would help the newly-formed states to consolidate power in their respective regions with nat. gov.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Population: 30+
Area: 1000 sq. blks

Instant dual federalism, as a population and area of this size would warrent completely provincial/state control in their own regions, with the power to nullify federal laws being their greatest assets.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 21</a><div class="page-content">       <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Conclusion

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>With these different political beliefs and government types, the path to an ideal government grows brighter and brighter as more and more Civs grow and die due to revolts or from improper usage of govt. Thank you for reading.</div></div>
