A loud screeching sound rang out through the Crucible. All of the men immediately got ready, Diet_Cola, a shotcaller from Hjaltland stood at the ready, called his men forward, and prepared for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">onslaught of NATO fighters about to pierce through the Crucible trench wall. The men grew tense, as the sound of screeching slowly grew louder, and finally, with a loud crack, 10, no 20 NATO fighters poured out of the breach in the wall. "PREPARE BUFFS",</div></div>

Topaz4293, and Infra_ had arrived in the Crucible the day the vault had been defended by Diet_Cola. Shadedoom quickly briefed them on the status of the situation, and both knew what to do.</div></div>

The skybridge was barely held up, as the stability of the sky rings was critical, however Topaz,</div></div>

The skybridge was quickly assembled by the Valyrian and Coalition builders, who set their sights on Polska. The skybridge quickly made its way towards Polska, at an exponential speed. The remaining NATO fighters at Polska could be</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">much for some to handle. However, Valyria and Columbia pushed on.</div></div>

Nearly 8 months after the Valyria conflict had ended, the dragon's scars had finally been made visible. The obsidian haze surrounding Valyria had slowly dissapeared. Doommad kneeled next to the dragon, its body laying limp.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">He called on the Columbians and Valyrians to help him carry the dragon to the center of the crucible.

All of the lights were dimmed in Columbia that night, as it was the solemn anniversary of the Rhodesian Coup. However, a light was shining bright from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">within the Crucible. What was this light the citizens of Valyria wondered? Suddenly, without a hitch, a massive roar was heard from within the depths of the Crucible. Suddenly the sky rings shook, and the ground rings exploded into flame, something had</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">of light, the dragon rose into the sky, Valyrians and Columbians stood, watching in shock. The sight was incredible, the dragon had been reborn, and it was flying. Less than a year after Azula had killed it, and everyone could see it. Shadedoom watched</div></div>
