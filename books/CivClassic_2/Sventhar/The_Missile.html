<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't by subtracting where it is from where it isn't or where it isn't from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference or deviation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where is isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't it now is.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Consequently the position where it is, is now the position that it is wasn't that it follows that the position that it was is now the position that isn't in the event that the position that it is in is not the position that is wasn't the system has</div></div>

If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However the missile must also know where it was.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 8</a><div class="page-content">The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows because a variation has modified some of the information. The missile has obtained it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't within reason and it knows where it was.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 8</a><div class="page-content">It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't or vice versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and variation which is called error.</div></div>
