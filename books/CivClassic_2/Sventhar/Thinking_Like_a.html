<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>land. It tingles in the spine of all who hear wolves by night, or who scan their tracks by day.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Even without sight or sound of wolf, it is implicit in a hundred small events: the midnight whinny</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>My own conviction on this score dates from the day I saw a wolf die. We were eating lunch<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>on a high rimrock, at the foot of which a turbulent river elbowed its way. We saw what we<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>thought was a doe</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the bank toward us and shook out her tail, we realized our error: it was a wolf. A half-dozen<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>others, evidently grown pups, sprang from the willows and all joined in a welcoming melee</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">of wagging tails and playful mauUngs. What was literally a pile of wolves writhed and<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>tumbled in the center of an open flat at the foot of our rimrock. In those days we had never heard of passing up a chance to kill a wolf. In a second we were</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>downhill shot is always confusing. When our rifles were empty, the old wolf was down, and a<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>pup was dragging a leg into impassable slide-rocks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>then, and have known ever s'ince, that there was something new to me in those eyes - something known only to her and to the mountain.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>mountain agreed with such a view.</div></div>
