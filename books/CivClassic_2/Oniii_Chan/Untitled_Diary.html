You come across a pile of loose pages. As you read, it becomes obvious that the pages have been organized to tell a story...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 31</a><div class="page-content">24th of Iron, 243 YAE

I took a walk through the forest today. The trees down here are always pretty, although I know enough to know they aren't normal. Although it was only once, I was able to visit up there long enough to tell that one.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The trees up there have green, soft leaves that eat the sun, and trunks that are used to produce wood.

We don't have much wood anymore.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The trees down here have leaves that are see-through and brittle like glass. Connected to these leaves are branches and trunks that are themselves harder than wood, brilliantly white like marble or quartz, and engraved with intricate patterns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I'm not sure who engraved the patterns. Maybe it was the trees themselves?

It'd be easier to tell if not all of the trees were grown up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Attached to some of the branches are blueish white fruits. They grow with a pale blue light, and feel warm to the touch.

The previous elder told me before he died that the trees here survive by something called radiosynthesis. I'm not sure what that means.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">On the walk, I found a few mushroom patches. The first three looked like the poisonous ones that elder showed me when I was young, so I avoided stepping on them. The fourth was edible. I picked them all, and even dug up the mycelium. It's all edible, and we can't afford to waste food.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 31</a><div class="page-content">8th of Malach, 244 YAE

Food has gotten pretty scarse. Those bastards won't sell us much bread anymore. Not that we've got much of anything to sell back to them in the first place. To make things worse, the edible mushrooms don't grow much either.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">They're the ones that exiled our founder here nearly three hundred years ago, so why are they acting with such selfishness? I know they are in a time of plenty. After all, they had the audacity to invite us to vote in their election. In their capital. That we can't visit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I'm hungry. I ate a rat the day before yesterday. My sister ate some weird white clay-like dirt today. She said it tasted sweet. I'd beleive her. I'd eat it myself if she hadn't already eaten everything that was left.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Those bastards from the capital said that this hunger is to pay for the sins of our founder. I think it's just to line their pockets and to appease their voters.

I'm hungry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">9th of Malach, 244 YAE

It's been three days since I've eaten. I've decided to go into the forest and eat the first thing I find. I don't care if it's a poison mushroom or a rock. I just need to fill my stomach with something.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">9th of Malach, 244 YAE

I came back from the forest. I forgot that each of the trees have their own fruits. How silly of me. I plucked a few from the closest tree and sunk my teeth into the fruits. It tasted like copper, and salt. It was crunchy and dry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">It was food though, so I kept eating. The naturally warm flesh of the fruits was like a meal, so I filled my stomach as much as I could. My mouth, my throat, and my stomach felt warm and itchy, but it was the first time in a while that I felt full.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 31</a><div class="page-content">

* A note is tucked into the stack of papers. Written on obviously whiter paper, in better handwriting, it's obvious this note was taken way after this diary was written. *</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Duck man. I don't want to spoil what happened to this kid, but it's not pretty. If you've got a queasy stomach or don't like descriptions of medical gore, you should probably stop reading.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">11 of Malach, 244 YAE

I threw up yesterday. There was blood in my puke. I've got a fever now, and I've got a bad rash on my back and legs. When I casually told one of those bastards from the capital that I ate the fruits of the forest, he rushed for a doctor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I don't think the doctor is going to help me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 31</a><div class="page-content">12 of Malach, 244 YAE

The doctor arrived this morning, awakening me. I thought I was feeling a bit better, so I tried to stand up. That was a mistake. I tripped and cut myself on the rusty bedframe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Strangely, the doctor was helpful. He bandaged my cut and gave me antibiotics. Maybe he isn't so bad after all. He also brought me some food, although I wasn't hungry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The strange thing is that even though hours have passed, my cut is still bleeding. I hope that those antibiotics weren't actually poison.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 31</a><div class="page-content">13 of Malach, 244 YAE

I woke up this morning in a pool of sweat and blood. I'm still bleeding, and it's not just from my cut anymore. Even though I took antibiotics, my cut is already infected.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Doesn't it usually take longer for a cut to become infected? Not to mention those antibiotics. They must have been poison. After all, pretty much my entire body is covered in rashes now. Whenever I sit up, the world spins around me and I pass out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 31</a><div class="page-content">14 of Malach, 244 YAE

The skin on my back fell off. All I can smell now is rotting and that salty metal. I'm covered in bandages and blood. My head feels like fire, and I want to vomit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 31</a><div class="page-content">To make matters worse, I overheard the doctor speaking to one of the bastards. Aparently, he's just here to "study" me. For that, he needs to keep me alive as long as possible.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I told my sister. I told her to kill me. I didn't catch much of what she said, but there was something about a ritual. I hope that I don't have to see that bastard doctor again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 31</a><div class="page-content">



* The next entry is written on the same paper, but with different handwriting.*</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 31</a><div class="page-content">16 of Malach, 244 YAE

I talked to the elders yesterday about releasing my brother from his pain. It was slow and difficult, but I managed to convince them to perform the ritual of release.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Naturally, the doctor from the capital objected. He tried to make some argument about how all life is valuable, if for even a second longer. We all knew what he was up to. In the end, he ended up helping out my cause more than his own. How helpful of him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Today was the day we chose to conduct the ritual. Being his closest familly member, I was chosen to hold the knife. My dear brother, although disfigured, was asleep at the time we chose to do the ritual.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 31</a><div class="page-content">And so, as everyone else performed their designated role, whether it be singing, burning incense, drumming, or so on, I waited for the cue from the elder. When it was time, I aimed the knife at his withered neck, and plundged it in.</div></div>
