>first day of spring at my university
>snow has melted, birds are chirping, and I can finally shed my winter jacket
>head to computer science, first class of the day
>kind of running late, so I sprint across campus to make it in time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">>by the time I get there I have a bit of sweat built up
>sit in my seat right during attendance
>I look around and realize that I'm the only male in the entire class
>everyone else is a boymoder</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">>they all look kind of uncomfortable
>it's clearly too hot to wear oversized hoodies, so they are all wearing loose tshirts instead
>boymoders without their hoodies are like turtles without their shells</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">>it leave them vulnerable and exposed
>plus you can see their little tits poking through their shirts
>however they seem to be panting, breathing heavilly, stuck in a daze
>suddenly one sticks their nose in the air, and sniffs like a dog</div></div>
