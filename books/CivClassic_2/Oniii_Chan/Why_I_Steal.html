<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 20</a><div class="page-content">An autobiography by Amelorate, aka Oniii_Chan.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Robokaiser:
@Amelorate why do you steal crafting tables?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Alright so it goes way back to very early civclassics.
The year was 2017.
I was a member of the USA, also known as VVault Disney Land.
The USA was poortea's nation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Along with the rest of the nation, I too wanted to snitch, raid, and pvp.
However, I didn't want any of the consiquences of snitching and raiding. I wanted to be able to know if a town had snitches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">My master plan was to break into every house and steal all of their workbenches.
If they messaged me about the workbenches, I would know that they had snitches and to avoid them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content">If I didn't hear anything, I would go ahead and snitch and raid the place.
The obvous flaw in this plan is that if I don't get any messages that doesn't mean that they don't have any snitches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">So instead I just went around the entire map stealing horrible amounts of workbenches.

It was fun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">However, eventually my habits caught up to me. After being in commonwealth for the second time, I was mistaken for a raider.
I was pearled, and despite not fighting back and offering reps, I was sentanced for a week because of some random big dog on an alt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">It was probably bewsiej trying to break into the bunker my pearl was in, aganst my reccomendations.
As expected, I was freed after a week. However, a certain Saren_Solaris invited me to Southshire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">This Saren_Solaris, whom I was in VC with, pearled me "to clear me of claims," as I was thinking of becoming a southshire citizen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Instead, he transfered my pearl to poortea by first running towards the US, then freeing me to my own bed, with poortea right next to it with killaura enabled.
I was placed into the US vault, of the same nation I was a citizen of.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">My crime: Stealing too many foreign workbenches.
The sentance: 60 years, IRL.
I was perma.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Not discouraged, I spent weeks running around and jumping in the end, admiring my stash of accidentally duped workbenches, created in a previous incident involving poortea and snitches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">I also met peter there, and helped to fund his castle after my 300d bounty on poortea failed to turn out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Nevertheless, I eventually found my pearl to be inside lexington's vault. The same vault that, had I been free, I would have likely been defending myself.
According to poortea, bewsiej had transfered my pearl aganst orders.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">From then, I knew I was perma and eventually quit the server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Nearly three years later, a certain Oniii_San logs in to the ruins of Lexington City and makes their way towards Icenia City, to begin anew as the alt of a buildfag.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 20</a><div class="page-content">This is a true story. The events described in this book led to the eventual exposure of Saren_Solaris as an insider.</div></div>
