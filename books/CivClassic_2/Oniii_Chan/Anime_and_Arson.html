    May 10th, 2021

    This morning, I woke up and logged into CivClassics. After running around in circles for a few minutes, as I always start my day, I came across ICENIA MAPS.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">





It was on fire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Furthermore, there was a sign conspicously nailed to the front door of ICENIA MAPS:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">





anime bad</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">I immediately checked snitches, and found the arsonist was the newfriend who had joined Icenia just days prior: squ8i.

I immediately told the Icenian Militia he was POS, however Charlieseeese told me he was nice, and shouldn't be pearled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">As a result, I opened a case in the justice channel of the Icenia discord. I provided evidence of the crimes committed, and argued that the crimes committed were in fact a hate crime against anime lovers in Icenia. As a result, I requested fair reperations and began the case.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The newly elected Grand Judge 1drop took the case, but failed to tell the defendant that he had a right to a lawyer. Being the nice, peaceful anime lover I was, I told the newfriend this fact.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">However, in globalchat, people claimed that this was merely an attempt by big anime to silence the small newfriends of Icenia. This of course is impossible. Why would I have told the newfriend he has a right to a lawyer if I didn't want a fair trial to begin?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">As a result of this accusation and others, I ran a poll on the Civclassics server to see how many people love and hate anime.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">




The results were shocking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Nearly half of the players on civclassics absolutely despised anime, and would do anything to get rid of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">This correlated with my own observations. Just the previous month, a bill was proposed in the Icenian Grand Council. It wanted to ban all anime map art within Icenia and banish anime lovers from its borders.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The good judge drop soon came to a judgement. He ordered squ8i to pay 5 diamonds in reperations and undo all damages.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">However, this wasn't the end to squ8i's anime-hating crime spree.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The next day, he went to Gensokyo's Sea of Tranquility and attempted to grief the great map art found out at sea.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">This lead the full wrath of the world police to come down upon him. Before he managed to do any significant damage, or even for most gensokyoians to awaken, he was soon pearled and brought to true justice for his anime-hating ways.</div></div>
