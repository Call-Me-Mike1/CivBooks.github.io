<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 22</a><div class="page-content">I came to CivClassic on a lazy morning in January, as the server had piqued my interest a few weeks prior after hearing about it while looking at minecraft builds online. I saw something that seemed truly grand to me. Any place dedicated to history, culture, and society was a server</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">that interested me. To think that I could become a citizen of a country, or read books by other blocky builders like me, or possibly forge a new nation. (I was nothing if not ambitious and naive). But I digress. I spawned near the outskirts of a town. (Possibly Sovia, if memory serves).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">From there I traveled around, quietly taking in the sights and tromping around the trails. Eventually, I found myself traveling around the grand city of Sigmaringen, capital of Prussia. I did some more wandering about, visiting some other cities, and eventually found myself back there in Prussia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Unfortunately, things went a bit sour from here. I was wandering the city, and being the "newfriend" that I was, I wanted to go explore every nook and cranny in the city. Of course, I was not yet accustomed to the concept of locking doors. This is where the problem arose.
I realized that all I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">had to do to enter any building I wanted was to break down the door. Of course, this was a terrible idea, but my curiousity got the better of me. I went and hacked down the door with an axe and entered the building. That building was the embassy. My already idiotic idea was made worse by my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">ignorance of the importance of keeping embassies private. I figured that Minecraft meant "go ahead and walk around all these buildings and gawk at the neat little things people made." This assumption ended up being the problem. I was approached by an intimidating figure in iron armor and killed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">(I'm going to keep their name private out of respect). I lost all my stuff, and I was quite angry. Of course, I responded with hostility. My first words after respawning were, and I quote "bro wtf". From where I was standing, it seemed like unprovoked murder simply for wandering</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">the city. (Really puts the "trap" in "tourist trap"). In any case, the armored guy began chewing me out. I honestly didn't know what to say, partially because I was angry, and partially because I was new and stupid. Eventually, I left the city, spared from being stabbed a second time.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">(I'd like to say again that I hold no animosity towards the Prussians based on this first impressions. As long as they are reasonable going forward, I'm more than glad to put this ordeal behind us. Also, apologies for the door). After leaving the city, I made a vow not to return again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">I was angry, and assumed that they were all just jerks, and would hunt me down. I was correct about the latter statement. I traveled along the railroad towards the next city, and was walking in an alley before getting jumped. In an unsurprising turn of events, I was killed by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">a diamond clad warrior in less than 5 seconds. My escape failed. Then I noticed the worst part. I had been pearled. No warning, no confrontation, just ambushed in an alley and assassinated. I was pretty mad. The diamondy warrior sent me a few messages. At this point, I was done.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">There wasn't a chance I would simply sit around and explain what happened. How could I? I barely understood the situation myself! Luckily, my pearlholder was quite reasonable, sending me links and other help to learn CivCraft. (You know who you are, and I must thank</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">you for the assistance, but i'm still mad about the pearl). I was sentenced to one day of pearl prison, and naturally, I was mad. Of course, the madness subsided quickly, knowing that there was nothing to be done. I was at their whim. Of course, I could still travel, and so I took a boat and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">put as much distance between me and Prussia as I could. I considered writing a scathing polemic and showing everyone what terrible people the Prussians were, killing and pearling a new guy for breaking a door. But I realized that I was being unreasonable. They weren't being malicious</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">at all. Perhaps a bit unreasonable, but not in an especially rude way. They were dispensing "frontier justice", the standard for law in Minecraft, in very many places. I still stand by the statement that pearling someone for vandalizing a door (particularly if they don't know better) is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">highly excessive, but such is the way of this land. Being pearled wasn't terrible, and I could still write this book, which I hope to serve not as a diatribe, but as a cautionary lesson in 2 parts. 

1. Be reasonable with pearls. Rudeness and vandalism should not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">warrant such a lofty sentence. Perhaps some might disagree with that statement, but I would openly say that such people are wrong, and ultimately are making a mockery of the power of pearls.

2. If you're new, remember that things are different here.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">This is a civilizzed world, full of nations and people that are largely benevolent. Try to remain composed, calm, and avoid messing with other people or their things, no matter how interesting it looks. Do not let curiosity be a problem like it was for me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 22</a><div class="page-content">This lesson, of course, is not the only purpose of this book. No, I also intend this to be an apology of sorts. When I was first confronted by the Prussians, I was quite upset and acted with hostility. Such words and actions are not becoming of civil folks, and I deeply apologize for both my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 22</a><div class="page-content">actions and my rudeness. Ultimately, if this book should ever come into the hands of Prussian officials, know that I have no hard feelings. This was all a misunderstanding, and I apologize for breaking the embassy. In conclusion, already I have learned much from my short time,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 22</a><div class="page-content">and yet I still have much to learn. But this story is not about that. No. This is the account of My First Day.</div></div>
