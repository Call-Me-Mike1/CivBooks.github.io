<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Wichita has departed from Yoahtl with little or no trace as to who he is or where he came from. Leaving behind a legacy of mindfulness and kindness. In his wake he appoints myself; Quauhtli, as the next chieftain of Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We come to find a new server after the one we previously lived in dies, as always. However right off the bat, the server seemed different already. It had *Plugins*. Things we had never seen on a server before. HalybrdCraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 33</a><div class="page-content">but at first we brushed it off, as our main concern was finding a place to settle down. So we set off from the spawn point and traveled towards the rising sun and moon as Wichita has many times before me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Eventually we came upon a small clearing between the first jungles and rivers. It was a bit of isolated plains, divided in two by said river, the clearing was caught between the jungles, and river. The plains themselves were much larger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">cut off only by a large range of Extreme hills. It felt like an ideal place to live, so I and the other Yoahtlan decided to settle down in the clearing. A camp was setup with jungle wood huts and tidings, and when we knew we would stay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content">I named it "Achtopollitlan"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>which should mean "land of the first tribe." And as the week went on the small camp turned into Yoahtl's first "town" since Xephos. It was the first formal use of a mesoamerican style implied by our Xephos forebears.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Our first use of stone brick. We experimented a bit and got a feel, as we grew the town further. The first small pryamids were born, dedicated to the old names of Yoahtl; like Eoahtl and Wichita. Yoahtl began to prosper, already now was our time there far</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 33</a><div class="page-content">more different than what we had known from the nomadic mindset we had come to know before. And we liked it. It was just what I wanted.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But despite these pleasant and calm times, it was still a very alien server. It was our first factions server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 33</a><div class="page-content">The concept of these plugins were very new to us, and we neglected to try and learn them. And it would come to haunt us. For eventually a band of players armed in enchanted arms and armor had come to lay waste to what we had created.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It was the first time many of us had experienced actual PVP, myself included. And the best we could muster was vanilla armors. We stood no chance. The city and the jungles were set aflame by lava grief.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">and as we died, we began to notice that our town was slowly becoming "claimed" by whoever these raiders were.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>All seemed lost; as we began to fear the lucidity we came to find was but an illusion, a snap back to the reality of nomadic drifting.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">But that was not the case! For to our rescue came several mods, with great armor and arms, flying across the sky with godly bows raining down onto the raiders like rain, it was insane. The raiders retreated quickly, as they spammed the chat in ferocity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">The claims undone, and the threat nuetralized, the mods left as quickly as they arrived. But our town and our future as a "Civilization" would not have gone much further if it was not for them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Yoahtl was safe, for now.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We then did out best to alleviate the damages done by the raiders as quickly as possible. The leaf and log speckled jungle and the river turned black. All eventually fixed, as well as the numerous griefs. And Yoahtlan continued on gleefully.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">But the true test of our new future came about in the form of a server reset. As all we had worked for was quickly and suddenly wiped without warning. We were faced with ah internal debate as wether to leave and look elsewhere, as before. Or stay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We had tasted the nectar of progress and "civilization" and we had come to find ourselves wanting yet more. And so we decided to stay, and try to find our way through what seemed like a totally new server on its own. Hoping it would stay alive.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And it did. It grew several sized infact, 30 people a day, and still growing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The server was new, and our community refreshed with the idea of new possibilites and new begginings. Only this time; with more meaning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We set out from the spawn, heading once again to the rising sun and moon. For several hours we continued on the path, on foot and boat. Through serveral continents and oceans. Untill we came upon what seemed to be a continent on the edge of the map.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">There we found a great and large plains biome, at the foot of a mountainous jungle, split by rivers. There, before it all was a great gulf of water, a sea. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was there we decided we would create a city, the first since those we'd heard of in Xephos.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We swifty named it after the aztec god of water, "Tlaloc."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The energy of the time was ecstatic and exciting as we cleared bits of land and mined heavily for stone and tools. And for the first time for a very long time, we thought of truly building.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">An almost child-like excitment could be felt in the air around all who participated, like an electricity as we all contemplated what we wanted to see. So many plans, and much excitement. It was almost as if the city was already set before we began.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And as we began to build the city, our perception of what counted as "large" got larger. The first pryamids greater in scale compared to those in Achtopollitlan, twice as large infact. And with new designs created by various people in Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">The act of building became an act of sculpting, an artform of its own as more and more people took interest, and a special style began to form. Our own ways of buildings and constructing our first infanstructure. The Huehuetlic culture was returning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And while all of this took place, Yoahtl's member count skyrocketted as more and more people decided to join, as other "factions" began to die out.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And we as a community finally began to catch on to the ways and plugins of the server as well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And as Yoahtl finally began to root itself in "factions" and use claims, we grew further.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For it should be known that the implication of plugin such as factions on what was was a small community like Yoahtl, meant great change.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">For now we *had* to develop *some* sense of government structure. Though it was not emphasized, we simply evolved. The need to kick several members who were not active enough and took up "Power" created the neccesity for such action.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And so the begginings of Yoahtl as a political entity began; all while its community-centric roots were still very much deep in the soil of what IS Yoahtl.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was also because of this, we saw the need of the first Warriors since Xephos.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Players in enchanted armor tasked with defending our people and interests. For as our popularity grew, so too did those willing to topple it, though usually always in small numbers. Our member count grew to 40 overall, and we would often ward them off.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">As we became the top "faction" on the server, our sphere of influence grew as we were soon able to make a second settlement in a desert biome on our continent, protected by claims made by us. For the use of digging sand for glass. Which we began to use.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We began giving names to the regions on our continent, as well as the continent it self' The desert and desert town itself called Aztlan, the plains; Tikal. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Further still, Yoahtl itself continued to grow, diamond production was nearly infinite.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It was a Huehuetlic Renaissance. The meaning and spark of "civilization" returning to the people of Yoahtl, an exit from the "Nomadic" mindset and back into a "Civilized" one.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Huehuetlic culture became more defined.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 33</a><div class="page-content">And thus was the dawn of Yoahtl's Crystal Age.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The flame of the Huehuetlic culture reignited and its drive to survive became stronger. But always it seems as when things get well, conflict must arise; as such was Halybrd and the Crystal Age.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 33</a><div class="page-content">For soon was Yoahtl's so far unwaned peace, was about to become interrupted by conflict; the War of the Horses was dawning.</div></div>
