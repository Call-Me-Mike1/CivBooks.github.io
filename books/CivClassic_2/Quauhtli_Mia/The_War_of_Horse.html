<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Entering a Huehuetlic Renaissance; our culture becomes more defined with the onset of higher organization.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 38</a><div class="page-content">However; the time of relative peace ended when people started to see pixel art and towers form near the capital town of Tlaloc.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was only with further investigation we had come to find that a new faction had quickly arose in the lands nearby.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 38</a><div class="page-content">This faction hailed itself as "Mylttlpny", and had come to claiming parts of the continent  as their own.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>With further inspection and the first dialogue between the Yoahtlan and they. We would come to discover that they were; among the first "Bronies."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And it there were many of them. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Many of the older and newer Yoahtlan alike held them in negative esteem due to thier incessant building of pixel art, and how close to the capital they had gotten. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 38</a><div class="page-content">So to try and avoid a conflict; Our first diplomatic mission to the bronies of Mylttlpony was organized.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Meetings were held in the brony homebase of "Tuton" very near to Tlaloc.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The first topic discussed was *why* they chose to settle where they did; when it was clearly Yoahtlan. At which point the bronies quickly exclaimed that they had come to settle the land far before the Yoahtl had arrived.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Negotiations quickly went sour.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Exclaiming that the land was thiers. This angered and tipped already overflowing tensions within the Yoahtlan. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>War was declared against the bronies of Mylttlpny and 5 armored fighters quickly surrounded Tuton, and claimed the outer lands to Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Utilizing the servers faction "power" plugin. Yoahtl was able to surround and effectively blockade Tuton quickly; and it was then that fighting began to insue. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As fights would take place between Tuton and Tlaloc as members from both factions  fought.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 38</a><div class="page-content">It is well-noted in the factions servers that the more someone dies, the less power they have to thier name, and for thier respective faction. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Yoahtl utilized this fact when the fighting began; for the claims on land made are supported by said power.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The fighting was highstakes, for each time the power-to-claim tipped into the negatives; high priority areas could be claimed and ransacked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However; while the bronies had diamond armor and weapons like the Yoahtlan did. They lacked forsight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Yoahtl had reserves of arms and armor for such and occasion of prolonged and sporatic fighting/dying.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This alongside Yoahtl's superior numbers; they lacked. As the Bronies frantically tried to kill unarmed Yoahtlan in and around the Tlaloc area.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The initial fighting took place for about two hours and it ended the bronies no longer had the resources to continue fighting without losing Tuton.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And with a decisive Huehuetlic victory the battle was dubbed "The Battle of Horses".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 38</a><div class="page-content">After the battle and victory in the lands around in Tlaloc the Yoahtlan were able to solidify claims around the brony HQ Tuton while leaving parts of the builds and pixel art firmly within Huehuetlic claims, leaving it to fall prey to angry Yoahtlan.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 38</a><div class="page-content">With dozens of the towering pixel art and builds made by the bronies aflame; the Yoahtlan hastily built a wall of obsidian around what was not claimed by them already. Thus beginning the "Siege of Tuton"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The beggining of the Eradication of the bronies.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The siege was to be conducted in manner of which the bronies would be forced to fight the surrounding Yoahtlan.  As those who have already left Mylttlpony already left thier claims vunerable if more died. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Which would mean more burning pixel art.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The siege lasted four days as various small skirmishes took place, all of which tipped into the favor of the Yoahtlan as claims continued to dwindle onto the our side more and more.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>To a point where simply going outside for them meant getting bowed down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 38</a><div class="page-content">More and more of thier pixel art and crude buildings fell prey to angry Yoahtlan. Now setting aflame to thier pixel art and taking valuables; and in some instances, taking back what was lost in the first battle.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, it seemed as though the siege-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 38</a><div class="page-content">would end in an stalemate. And the public Yoahtlan rued the idea of having to live alongside them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So on the fourth day; the Yoahtlan set-up a newly learned method of bypassing claims; TNT Cannons. Though crude at the time. It was effective at exposing-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 38</a><div class="page-content">bronies trying to play without getting arrow'd and in some cases; outright killing them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The cannon fire and dying bronies prompted further and further claims into brony territory in Tuton. And the fires of Tuton would burn for the rest of the day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 38</a><div class="page-content">But at one moment later in the day; patrolling Yoahtlan at the siege hit a low, and the bronies noticed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Seemingly desperate and on thier last legs; they sallied forth with 7 armed players against the sleeping Yoahtlan, only 4 strong. Killing them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 38</a><div class="page-content">There was a breach in the claims made around the base of Tuton as they were able kill the defenders just enough to get out of the walls and kill the Yoahtlan as they spawned back in Tlaloc. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was only one hour later did more Yoahtlan log in to notice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And quickly they mounted a counter-offensive; driving back the bronies and killing them. And there they spawned back in Tuton. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And because of the breach in the obsidian walls and claims; waiting them out was no longer an option. A final assault was made.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 38</a><div class="page-content">As more Yoahtlan logged in; they all joined in to attempt to swarm Tuton to both seal the breach and deal the killing blow to the bronies.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And soon there were 12 armed Yoahtlan going into Tuton; killing all they could, whilst more shot more tnt from afar</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 38</a><div class="page-content">As holes were punched into the houses and HQ of the bronies; Yoahtlan began to slaughter them wherever they could. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So much to the point the very last claims to claim now were at the spawnpoint of Mylttlpony.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 38</a><div class="page-content">More pixel art and crude buildings set aflame; the Yoahtlan were now able to properly assault the brony HQ and spawnpoint; made of iron and gold blocks.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They flooded into the water-elevator that lead into a floating fortress of gold and iron.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 38</a><div class="page-content">We flooded them with as many people as we could and killing whoever tried to run away before they could TP or /spawn.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And as we continued to kill them; more of thier claimed began to cede to the Yoahtlan.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And by then; the last of thier claims was now left to the HQ alone; in which we would kill the remaining bronies over and over as they spawned back in.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And for only 4 minutes of this; the floating HQ was ours and the Yoahtlan cheered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The siege was over and the last of thier claims taken over; the victorious set aflame and removed everything crude-looking; and set the last of the pixel art alite as the HQ was ransacked of its blocks.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Tuton was ours.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Quickly after being allowed to see what happened to Tuton, the faction leader disbanded mylttlpny. Ending the War of Horses for a Yoahtlan victory.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>None of the mylttlpny were spared.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 38</a><div class="page-content">After the glorious victory the Yoahtlan took part in, I decided to make Tuton a town within the Yoahtlan; evicting the previous residents and installing some of the new Yoahtlan; while leaving the obsidian walls and improving upon the remaining houses.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Tuton was once a ordinary random ocuring village ( before tesitifacates were added). And we took advantage of this to add a wood-based aesthetic to the town.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>With sandstone and wooden buildings. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Tuton became a popular place to stay in Yoahtl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Many trees were planted as the last crude buildings and pixel art was burned down and removed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Thus Tuton became a symbol of Huehuetlic dominance on the continent and the server-alike as well as a testiment to how far they came since the nomadic way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 38</a><div class="page-content">After the proper annexation of Tuton Yoahtl began to see new heights in wealth never seen before; not even that rumored to be in Xephos.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Diamond became more abundant than iron as more elaborate pryamids and buildings were made.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The pryamids were now being addorned with Diamond, gold, iron, and lapis lazulli blocks in elaborate designs.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This level of retained wealth would not be seen untill the Age of Reclamation.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Things couldnt be better, or so it seemed.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Thus suddenly and rudely ending the Crystal Age.</div></div>
