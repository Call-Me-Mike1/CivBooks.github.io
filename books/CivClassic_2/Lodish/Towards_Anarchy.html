<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This prejudice explains why so many honest opponents believe Anarchism a thing impossible;</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Of course the triumph of Anarchism cannot be the consequence of a miracle; it cannot come about in contradiction to the laws of development (an axiom of</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 38</a><div class="page-content">but that we walk towards Anarchism today, tomorrow, and always. Anarchism is the abolition of exploitation and oppression of man by man, that is, the abolition of private property and government; Anarchism is the destruction of misery,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 38</a><div class="page-content">protected by the government, have stolen from the workers. The right of force having disappeared, the means of production being placed under the management of whoever wants to produce, the result must be the fruit of a peaceful evolution.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 38</a><div class="page-content">will reconstruct. For example, there functions in the present society the service of supplying food. This is being done badly, chaotically, with great waste of energy and material and with capitalist interests in view; but after all one way or another we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 38</a><div class="page-content">must eat. It would be absurd to want to disorganise the system of producing and distributing food unless we could substitute for it something better and more just. There exists a postal service. We have thousands of criticisms to make,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 38</a><div class="page-content">but in the meantime we use it to send our letters, and shall continue to use it, suffering all its faults, until we shall be able to correct or replace it.

<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 38</a><div class="page-content">remain in ignorance — refusing their learning to read and write. Meanwhile we wait and struggle for a time when we shall be able to organise a system of model schools to accommodate all. From this we can see that, to arrive at Anarchism, material force is</div></div>
