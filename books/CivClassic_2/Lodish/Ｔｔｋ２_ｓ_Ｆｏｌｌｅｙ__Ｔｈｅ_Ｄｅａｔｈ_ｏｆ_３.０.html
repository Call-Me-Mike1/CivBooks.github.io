Of these three groups, the most</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The reason it is important to talk about culture in this case is because the cultural makeup of the server was more than an inconsequential byproduct of roll-play, much like</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One of the most prominent and destructive side effects of the Old Civvie administration group running a server where their mentality died out years ago is one that is well-documented and pervasive among Old</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As the fear of repeating HCF invasions slowly disappeared in the general population of Civcraft, it persisted in the administration team and led to a series of unpopular decisions</div></div>
