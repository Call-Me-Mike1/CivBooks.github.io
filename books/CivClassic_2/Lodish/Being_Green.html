<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At least, not after<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>he came.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I have lived most of my life in a dark cave, only coming out at night, occasionally catching some rays<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>in the morning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Life was great: the "passives" kept to themselves above ground, and the zombies and spiders were my friends. (Though eventually you got tired of the zombies' constant groaning). Only skeletons were a bother, during their archery sessions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I had seem some distant relatives shot down for "records".<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One day, however, things changed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It started when the zombies started massing and coming from everywhere.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">It was night, and they were all leaving the cave. I thought that this might be a village raid, so I kept to myself initially.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>(I abhorred their mindless killing and infecting).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">But I knew something was wrong when I saw that barely a tenth of them had come back. Surely the villagers couldn't be killing them, and there wasn't a golem in the village. No, it had to be something else.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">The next morning, I peeked outside. I soon saw the source of the abnormality last night. Beyond the skeletons and zombies burning to a crisp on the hillside, I saw a house, though one unlike those of the villagers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">For one thing, it was made of dirt, and not wood and stone.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For another, there was a strange man inside it.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He was unlike the villagers - he had a short face and small nose, and wore a blue shirt and pants.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">In his hands was a pick axe, though occasionally he would swap this tool at incredible speed for another, such as a shovel or sword.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As I watched, he left the house, and began walking towards the cave, pick axe in hand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I quickly slunk back into a corner, wanting to observe this mysterious new visitor.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He entered the cave, placing torches on the wall as he went. Like the villagers,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>this man was afraid<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>of the dark.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">It was soon clear why: as he walked, zombies, skeletons and spiders came out of their recesses with incredible determination, all trying to punch, shoot, or jump on him. In response, he pulled out a sword, and began hacking at these monsters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Despite their efforts to stay alive, one by one they were cut down, with only some effort on the man's part. At that point, I realized that we<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>were up against a fearsome foe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I decided to follow him as he descended further into the cave, quietly following. I had to admire the care he took in clearing his path: he laid down dozens of torches, and used dirt to bridge his way across ravines.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Soon, we were near the bottom of the world. Along the way, he had been hacking at minerals and ores with his pick axe. Clearly these were valuable to him in some way. At one point, his pick axe snapped into pieces upon hitting the rock;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">somehow he produced a wooden box, like those in the village, which in turn produced a brand new pick axe.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At one point he turned to the cave's solid side, and began hacking away at it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Eventually, he stopped, and came back with a rough blue diamond in hand. He carried it with pride.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was then that I felt a great feeling come over me, an indescribable feeling of fury at this man,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">who had such love for such material objects. We mobs got by walking about peacefully in our dark caves, and now this intruder was killing off my friends and rendering this cave uninhabitable for some, only for his self gain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I ran at him, and as I did, my anger became an audible sizzling. The last sight I saw was of the man, desperately hacking at me, with a face of pure terror.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>BOOM</div></div>
