<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Tall, dark oak trees stretched up into the air; their branches spread out in all directions, forming a leafy canopy that blotted out the sky.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  She cast him a mischievous smile, which Gameknight ignored.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"But they do always seem focused on you," Digger added with a grin.  "Maybe it's just your sparkling personality the monsters like so much," Crafter added with a laugh. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "I feel like everyone's ganging up on me," Gameknight replied with a smile. "Everyone except for Butch."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">  The big NPC rode on a coal-black mare, his iron armor standing out against his animal's dark coat. In his hand, he held a shining iron sword; the purple waves of magic running up and down its length added to the glow being made by the sisters' bows.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Butch had said little since they'd left his village.

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">one of the holes had fallen to their death. Many NPCs had been killed--whole familes had been destroyed in the blink of an eye--and the rage that Butch felt over this atrocity was like a blazing fire within his soul.

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">sentences, and only when necessary. He also had developed a short temper, and because of that, few tried to actually speak with him, except for Gameknight999. The User-that-is-not-a-user could see how the big NPC was suffering, and he refused to let him</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Butch, it was a good idea to ride back to Crafter's village instead of taking the minecart network," Gameknight said. "We can check on the other villages on the way and make sure they all fared well after we deactivated Herobrine's</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Hmm," Butch grunted, but his mind was clearly elsewhere as he scanned the shadowy forest for monsters. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  They continued along at a leisurely pace. Then, suddenly, the big villager veered off the the right, urging his mount to a gallop</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">and giving off a loud battle cry as he held his sword up high. Gameknight kicked his horse into action and followed the villager. He drew his own diamond sword and steeled himself for battle.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "What is it? Spiders?" Hunter asked as she pulled alongside</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">him. "I don't know," Gameknight replied as he ducked under a low tree branch.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Suddenly, they burst into a clearing, the unexpected sunlight making Gameknight squint. Butch, ten blocks ahead of him, was charging at a lone zombie. Shooting past the</div></div>

This made it easy for Butch to make another pass without having to slow down and turn. After three hits, the zombie was gone--just a trio of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">glowing balls of XP was left floating on the ground. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Slowing his dark horse, the villager turned and headed back to the rest of his party, a satisfied expression on his face. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Are there any more?" Gameknight asked as he scanned</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content">the forest. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "No, just the one," Butch replied. "You mean you charged off all this way just to attack <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>one <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>zombie?" Stitcher asked. "We could have kept going, and the zombie never would have bothered us."  "It was a monster," Butch replied. "It</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">needed to be destroyed."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Butch, we don't need to destroy every monster we see," Crafter said as he moved his brown-and-white pony to the big NPC's side.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "They destroyed my village, and I will have my revenge," the big NPC growled in a low</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 43</a><div class="page-content">voice.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "But that zombie had nothing to do with your village being attacked," Stitcher pointed out. "It was Herobrine's command blocks that hurt your community."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Herobrine... monsters... it's all the same to me," Butch said with an angry scowl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Gameknight glanced at the NPC and wanted to say something to help, but he couldn't find the words. Butch had been devastated by the damage Herobrine had done to his village and the people living in it, and now his desire for revenge was like a disease</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 43</a><div class="page-content">eating at him from within.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Come on, we've got to get to the next village before nightfall," Digger said, purposely changing the subject. They'd learned that talking about Butch's violence yielded few positive results.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Pulling at his reins,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Butch wheeled his black mare back in the direction they had been traveling--southwest--and continued the journey. Urging their horses to follow Butch, the party shifted to a gallop as they wove their way around the thick trunks of the dark oak trees.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 43</a><div class="page-content">  They rode in uncomfortable silence. None of the companions knew what to say, and tension seemed to orbit around Butch like a moon trapped by gravity. Ahead, Gameknight could see the long shadows cast by the thick overhead canopy start to fade;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">they were reaching the end of the roofed forest.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Gameknight remembered fromt their last trip that a birch forest sat adjacent to this biome. The clean, white bark and the blue sky overheard would be a welcome sight. But as they left the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 43</a><div class="page-content">shadowy roofed forest, eveyone was shocked at what they saw. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The birch forest was burned to the ground--the entire biome had been completely destroyed. "What is this?" Gameknight asked, confused. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  No one replied; they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 43</a><div class="page-content">were all too stunned to speak.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Everything was burned: the trees, the branches. Even the grass that normally coated the ground between the birch trees was charred and black. But Gameknight noticed something else about the horrific scene: countless tree</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 43</a><div class="page-content">trunks lay on their sides, their charred carcasses marking their deaths like silent, ashen gravestones. That was unusual. Typically, when tree trunks fell over, they disappeared completely. So why were these left behind?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 43</a><div class="page-content">  Gameknight climbed off his horse and approached one of the fallen trees. Placing his hand lightly on its side, he dug his fingers into the trunk. It immediately crumbled to ash. He could see the area on the ground where the tree had once been planted,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 43</a><div class="page-content">but the now-barren spot had a glassy appearance to it, as if the base of the tree had been subjected to intese heat.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Kneeling, Gameknight rubbed his hand across the burned ground. The soil was like dirty, brown glass, the result of seared blades</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 43</a><div class="page-content">of grass and soil melted together. Jagged shards stuck up at different angles as if trying to escape the atrocity that had befallen the block. Gameknight felt like he was on some other planet in outer space.

<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 43</a><div class="page-content">kicked at the glassy surface. The soil shattered like fragile crystal, and the ground crumbled to dust.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "What could do this to the land?" Gameknight asked as he scrutinized the surroundings. As far as the eye could see, the birch forest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 43</a><div class="page-content">biome was completely destroyed. All trace of life had been erased from the surface of Minecraft.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "It must have been the monsters," Butch stated. "That is why we need to destroy them."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "We don't know that, Butch," Crafter said.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Maybe it was a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 43</a><div class="page-content">lightning strike that caused this fire."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The big NPC moved to a small hill and kicked it with his iron boot. The cubes of glassy dirt fell apart, turning to dust and revealing more glassy blocks underneath.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Are you telling me lightning did this... to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 43</a><div class="page-content">the whole biome?" Butch asked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Crafter did not reply. He just shook his head in shock.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "This was no ordinary fire," Digger said. "The flames were so hot they turned the soil to glass. This land will never support life again. It is a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 43</a><div class="page-content">premanent scar on the face of the Overworld.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "Agreed, but we can't just go off on a killing spree, destroying every monster in sight in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 43</a><div class="page-content">hope it might stop these tragedies," Crafter said, glancing at Butch.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  The big NPC wasn't listening. He was staring across the devastated forest, his eyes burning with rage. Gameknight's gaze swept across the wasteland; his own anger was close</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 43</a><div class="page-content">to boiling over as well. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "We must find out who is responsible for this and make sure it doesn't happen again," Butch growled.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "I think you're right, Butch," Gameknight replied.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  "They must be punished... they must</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  Gameknight heard the anger--the unbridled, barely contained rage--in the big NPC's voice. It made him scared, not for those responsible for that atrocity before them, but for Butch himself.</div></div>
