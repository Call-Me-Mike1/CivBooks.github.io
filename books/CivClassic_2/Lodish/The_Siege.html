A relatively carefree day of trading with the villagers for the goods they were so eager to share, for a small fee of course. Of course I should have known that in this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">strange and rugged land you can never become complacent and expect everything to be just fine. It was the kind of mistake every player makes at some point. The kind of mistake a player doesn't make twice, assuming they live through it that is.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">When I first arrived in this world I assumed I was alone, but after weeks of scouting out my surroundings I found a small village out on the plains not far to the east. Naturally I was excited about this find, especially when I learned that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">these villagers were friendly, unlike so many of the other creatures in this strange place. For the most part I found their demands to be fair. Wheat was plentiful enough, and I was happy to publish my journals for a few extra emeralds here</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and there. What I earned however didn't last long as I found that they had much to offer that I needed. In particular the priest with access to a sizable glowstone supply was a welcome surprise. While I could always get some myself, it's nice to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">be able to grab some now and then without having to dodge fireballs or hang precariously over enormous lakes of lava. I found myself spending more and more time at the village and I think it's fair to say I even regarded many of the villagers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">as friends. Still I had never spent the night in the town. I had my home and it was both secure and familiar making it a perfect retreat to weather the often turbulent evenings outside it's durable stone walls. As you can imagine this constant</div></div>

I'd leave early from my home riding my fastest horse with a pack mule in tow, spend the whole day trading with the villagers. Rest</div></div>

"Who knows," I had said to myself "perhaps I'll even kick back and share a</div></div>

Looking back, I see now that I had become complacent, assuming nothing bad could or would happen... Was I ever wrong. To say the evening hadn't gone quite as I'd imagined would be doing the term</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"understatement" a gross injustice. There was no warm meal and no soft bed this evening. Tonight was a night of cold iron, unsettling moans, and realized fears. Tonight was the first night of the siege, an event I had never heard of, nor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">ever even imagined possible, and one I fervently hoped would end sooner than it looked to. The first sign of trouble was a very loud banging on the door of the building I was spending the evening in, startling me so badly that I literally jump,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">turning a full 180 degrees in mid-air and bringing my sword down hard on the table that had snuck up behind me, only to realize as my panic subsided that the banging was in fact coming from outside the door. "I guess I owe the table an</div></div>

A zombie, very similar to the dozens I'd killed since finding myself in this strange land could be seen standing outside the door,</div></div>

"I'm still standing in front of the door," I think suddenly to myself. I have only moments</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to react. Too late! I feel the zombies hand claw at my back scratching furrows into my iron breastplate until finally it finds the joint where my breastplate and greaves meet and scores a small chunk of my flesh. It takes only seconds for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">this event to register in my mind and for my thoughts to coalesce into a single statement to sum up the emotions and thoughts suddenly coursing through my mind; "it's going to be a long night." Having little choice I spin quickly around as</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I find myself struggling to justify killing the creature. The moral dilemma quickly resolves itself however as this miniature zombie starts gnawing right through the material under the breastplate scoring a few small bites of fresh flesh.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">with a sudden cry of pain as the zombie's teeth find soft tissue I bring my sword around catching the thing by surprise, the sheer weight of the blade launching it across the room.

Another well placed swing atop its bulbous skull ends the threat of the baby zombie as three more come ambling through the door, their attention locked on the two terrified villagers huddling in the corner behind me.

"Hopefully that's a mistake I'll live to regret," I think to myself as I mentally prepare myself to take on these three zombies all alone... Suddenly an idea strikes me. "The zombies are so focused on the villagers I could probably</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">slip out of the house and away from the village largely unnoticed." I look back at the two cowering villagers hiding behind me in earnest as I contemplate leaving them to their fate. "This isn't my home and I'm not really that close to<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>

Those who aren't even brave enough to stand and fight in defense of themselves?" The priest suddenly lets out a typical "hmmm," a common enough thing amongst the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">villagers. This time however the sound comes off a bit plaintiff, arguable the closest thing I had ever heard to a villager begging for their life. As the priest looked at me and I back at him it became clear what must be done. I swung around</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">quickly, swinging as I did so and managed to catch the first zombie squarely in the chest with my iron blade causing him to stumble back, shifting his focus to me as he did so.

I turned to look at the building I'd been in not moments ago to see the farmer peeking out of the gaping hole left in the shattered door. Looking around I see more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">zombies on the horizon... many more. I quickly jog over to the building. "There are more coming. I'll seal you inside so you'll be safe." I begin to pile stones up in the doorway to create a more solid barrier, but the priest stops me. With a</div></div>

With a look to the heavens and a quick prayer over the sword the priest returned my</div></div>

I took it in my hands; it felt lighter than before. With a look I nodded my thanks to the priest and finished sealing them inside. As I turn to seek out my newly enchanted swords first</div></div>

I take my first swing with the new blade striking the closest zombie on the left side of its skull, the</div></div>
