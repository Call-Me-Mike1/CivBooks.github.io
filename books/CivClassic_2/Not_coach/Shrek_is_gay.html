<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Silently, Shrek lay awake in his bed. Too many thought have been surrounding him lately. "Is Fiona really the one for me?" "Can Ay' truly love er" "do onions really have layers" Shrek worries about these things endlessly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Suddenly, Fiona wakes up, or perhaps she was going through the same thing Shrek was, and gets up to walk to the bathroom. "Thank God she finally left, I couldn't stand to be around er fer a second longer..."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Shrek marvels at the fact that he now can't stand being around the woman he once loved, the woman he had children with, the woman he fought for...<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span>He sits up, and waits for Fiona to come back. He needs to end this now.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Fiona comes back, and when she sees Shrek awake, she seems a little startled, with a hint of disgust, and says "What are you doing up, Swine?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"We need to talk, ye whore" He responds. "Look, Ay can't do this anymore. Ay thought ye were the one. Ay thought that Ay'd love ye till' the end of time, but lately, Ay just don't think that anymore. I'm not sure what I should think..."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Shrek, I-!" she tries to blurt out. +"Don't try te' change my mind on this woman! Ye know we've been on and off for a while now, and plus lately...." he trails off?"What is it?" Fiona questions worriedly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Well Fiona... Ay... Ay think Ay'm gay. Whenever Ay see a hot man, say Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya De La Rosa Ramirez for example, Ay just feel all tingly inside, like Ay'm an onion about ta' get cooked. sweet, savory, and layered."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Shrek... I didn't know you felt this way... Why haven't you said anything before?" +"Because Fiona! Men aren't supposed to be like that! It's just plain disgusting" Shrek said, bursting with confused anger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Who told you that, your father? Remember, Shrek, that's the same man that tried to cook you as a child, it's not the best idea to take ideals from him." Fiona said supportingly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"It's okay, Shrek. I've figured you were gay for a long time now, especially with your obsession with anal and gay black thugs."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Thank ye, Fiona..." Shrek manages to finish. +They lay silently for the rest of the night, eventually trailing off to sleep, but Fiona falls asleep much faster than Shrek.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The next morning came, and Shrek confronted Fiona again. "Fiona," he said.
