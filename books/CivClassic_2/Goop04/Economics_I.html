<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>When discussing economics there are always the basics that attract the most attention. Such as trade, labor, currency, and the idea of corporations. 

In order to think about economics and economic stability in ones nation you need to evaluate the</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>individual parts of economics and the ways they can and probably will influence your country.

To start we can think of trade. Trade is an age old concept, one that every competent individual recognizes and understands regardless of formal knowledge on the topic</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>It is so basic in fact it has been observed as far back as third millenium bce.

The concept is rather simple, an individual trades goods or services for goods or services. 

This idea of existence and interaction is so engraved in the</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>human pysche that a toddler understands it.

Trade as a functional activity/interaction of a nation is greatly beneficial to the two or more nations or individuals involved.

Throughout history we have observed a modicum of methods</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>to allow for trade to occur.

Some of these methods include by land and sea. More complex methods require vast communication networks that are imperative to cross map interactions between parties.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>When looking at trade in the specific area of civ there is little to understand outside of these ideas/methods I have referenced.

The equivelent of a universal currency on civ is diamond. This material not only is representative of wealth it is used for production of tools</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>and armor. 

This usefulness has established diamonds as the cream of the crop when thinking of materials of value in terms of trade.

A unique currency is an interesting topic to ponder on civ. Would it work on a global scale.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Almost entirely not. However in a contained nation or alliance of nations.

This possibility and idea is one that I have thought of often. If a currency could be developed with an initial diamond equivalent then the possibilities are endless in a contained</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>scenario.

The next thing to consider when thinking of a nations economic stability is labor. 

Usually labor is divided and established in a fair and realistic manner. Individuals take on a labor that they are skilled enough at that</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>they maintain a high level of efficiency. As long as a nation does this they should be able to establish themselves as a virtuous workforce of productivity.

Now however immoral it is to consider, one cannot deny the great value that indentured workers would bring</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>to ones nation. This could be achieved in a multitude of ways. The easiest probably would be to pearl and work out an amount of labor to fulfill ones sentence.

Corporations are a difficult venture to bring to fruition. Not only would a formal corporation require</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>a very organized and idealized group of individuals that had the funds and passion to achieve an acomplishment such as this that is successful.

The reason a corporation is such a hard endeavor is that there is so much to the workings of a</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>successful corporation that most cannot do.

Some of these things are, finances, organization, production, employment, and marketing. If you save an abundance of wealth then that covers the initial finance concerns</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>of your corporation. 

The next important  idea to talk about is production. In order for your corporation to be successful you need to find goods or a service that are in demand and you can produce and still turn a profit. </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>This topic in particular is perhaps the biggest reason that corporations are not common on civ. It is almost impossible to find a good or service that one can't already do themselves.

Marketing is pretty self explanatory.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Through word of mouth, signs and map art and such, and advertising in chat(the last will probably annoy others). The trouble with marketing on civ is that if you don't already have a good reputation then your marketing attempts, aside from word of mouth, are likely to be ignored.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>And finally employment, employment is probably the easiest need to fulfill. Because the only scenario where you are seeking employees is if you're already successful. If this is true than finding potential employees should not be difficult.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 20</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>These ideas and concepts are just some of my thoughts on economics and economic happenings of your average civ nation. These are all purely hypothetical and opinionative. The legitimacy of these texts is purely dependent on the economic status of civ and the individual.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
