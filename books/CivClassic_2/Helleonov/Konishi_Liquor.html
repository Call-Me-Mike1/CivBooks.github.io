- Mambalgin: This one's a doozy! Made from top quality ingredients sourced from the rich farms of Lambat, this drink is unlike anything you've ever tasted before! Have you ever had a gin and tonic? Well, this is just like that... Except without the tonic.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Absinthe: The ingredients for this one are sourced directly from the lush fields of the Sussex Empire. If all you want is to see how strong of a hangover you can get in a block game, this one is for you! Two bottles and you'll be out cold on your basement floor! Or is that just me?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Russian Vodka: I mean, it's vodka! This one, however, is pretty weak compared to the real thing. The best part about this drink is binge eating potatoes afterwards to get rid of the drunkennes. How much more Russian can you get?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Fairy Tail: Despite its name, the quality of this drink is no fairy tale! I mean, even with Blindness II you would be able to notice it. And who could have guessed such a weird ingredient made for such a good brew? You'll be pleased to know we promoted the guy who discovered it. He is now me!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Wheatbeer: Are these drinks too much for you? Do you just want a drink to relax on a rainy night? Well, look no further! This premium beer is aged to perfection in our finest barrels and, at that price, it's a steal! Grab two, drink one here and run home to store the other one before it gets warm!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Lapis Vodka: This is the real deal! This drink is one of Fort Lapis' signature drinks and it shows. After years of research and countless sleepless nights, our brewers managed to perfect the recipe. According to the brewer who discovered it, he was "playing Sonic '06 one</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">day when the recipe came to him during a glitch". He drank a bottle and was never seen again. Please let us know if you saw him. His chickens are alone and we're all craving KFC at the brewery lately...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Santa's Betrayal: If you thought Christmas 2020 was bad, wait until you bring this to your family next time you visit them! They'll be really slow to forgive you. Maybe you should have brought them Wheatbeer instead. This brew was also aged to perfection, however the number</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">of years was so precise, the brewer in charge had nightmares for a week after losing two full batches of this drink in our barrels. They have since been cleaned and we found a psychiatrist for the brewer. We hope someone takes care of his 8 children, 2 of which are llamas.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- RÃ©my Martin: All I know about this drink IRL is a great old-school brazillian song called "todos os sentidos". However, here in civ we have, after a lot of attempts, perfected this fine cognac's brewing process so you can feel extra fancy when drinking it by Lambat's beautiful</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">sea. Its negative effects will be quick to pass, leaving only its sweet aroma on your nostrils and its fascinating taste in your mouth. It's certainly our smoothest drink, and the difficulty to procure its ingredients is the main responsible for its slightly higher price.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">- Gravel Hammer: "But Helle! These drinks are not useful in any way! I can't use any of them to help in a fight!" Worry not, customer, for here at Konishi Liquor Store we know that the customer is always right. Look no further than this wonderful drink made of stuff you didn't even think</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">possible! Want to startle your friends? Want to punch the President and watch as he looks around confused? Want to rob The Crucible? (Please don't do that. We are not resposible for any stupid things our customers do). Then the gravel hammer is for you! One drink and you can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">freely take off your armor, knowing no one else is seeing your birthday suit! Be careful, however, as extra drinks won't make you extra sneaky, just extra drunk.

We hope it proved to be useful and we hope you now can better decide which one of our drinks best fits your needs. Are you disappointed? Did you expect more options or something specific?
