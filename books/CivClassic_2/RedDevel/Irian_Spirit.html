<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 10</a><div class="page-content">There's an island out there with orange clay plateaus that are covered in green and blue. No, i'm not talking about the flags. i'm talking about the flowing rivers and luscious grasslands that cover it. It's a place with a view so grand you'd suddenly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">develop a fear if heights. I am of course talking about Iria.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span>Many may think we Irians are dead, but i'd tell them they were wrong, we never truly die. Iria is much like icarus were he a phoenix.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">We fly high into the sky to reach the great shiny orb we can all see. Only to realize too late that the orb was never meant to be reached. To late, because by the time we realize this painful fact we are already too tired to begin our slow decent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">We don't melt when we get to high, we burn ourselves up. And so, we fall back to the earth and crash into the ground as hard as possible. We then lay there with our broken feathers and bones as the last remaining embers from our body disappear into -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">the wind, never to be seen again. At least that's what we think, we always think it's our end, that the last breath has been drawn. But as soon as that light goes out, it sparks back up and becomes as bright as ever. Causing us to begin our cycle again..</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Now, you could argue that we should stop flying so high every time we get resurrected and to instead take it easy. And that it would be wiser to construct a solid base before building so high. my response to that would be: bollocks!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">If we were not who we are, how would we keep rising from the ashes? How would we show the word our beauty if we lacked our vigour when born anew? The only thing we'll build on are our goddamned ashes! this is the Irian spirit, we do not slow ourselves -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">down to finished our previous projects! it looks great as is. Nobody will notice it's missing a roof, who even looks at the roofs? Are you a roof-looker?!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">ยง0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Forgive me, i sometimes forget myself. What is was trying to convey is that, this is who we are. We can't and won't change that. We can only hope that the current phoenix doesn't lose it's energy as fast as the last.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 10</a><div class="page-content">And that if it does, we will be born again. For if we don't, who else would build these unfinished projects.</div></div>
