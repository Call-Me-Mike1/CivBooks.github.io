It's <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>very...grassy<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>. Lots of trees, sprinkled with flowers and other forest decorations.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I look to my side and notice a closed book, My eyes dart to the cover.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The cover read, 'What is this.' I thought, I pick it up and open it up, the pages have an odd purplish glow to them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I began attempting to read the perculiar book. "This is complete gibberish" I thought.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It was written like this, intentionally It seemed, was It to mess with me? I close the book and put it to my side, Night is coming soon and I need shelter, I begin wandering in the direction that felt best. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I discover a dirt hut, it appeared to be ransacked, a single chest and a dirty, sand ridden red bed, something was under the covers, moving slighty. Curiosity got the best of me and I pulled off the covers,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I immediately jumped as a bunny with something dangling in its mouth jumped off the bed and ran out one of the many holes in the hut, I turned back to the bed and was shocked by The human skeleton lying in the bed. Night was falling I needed shelter and a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">place to sleep. I grabbed the skeleton by its legs and began dragging it out, their body leaving a noxious odor. After I was done I gathered some dirt and went back inside to seal the hut and sleep. I did that exactly, except the sleeping part.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I just couldn't sleep, I was just awaken by a sudden jolt of force. Like your mother trying to wake you up for school and you're late. I figured if I wasn't going to sleep, I was going to be productive. I began punching at the dirt floor below me, making</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">a hole, yelping in pain 'Dammit!' as my now bruised knuckles strike the cold stone, I needed tools, I ran out the door and began punching the wood trees, serveral minutes later, multiple floating trees later I got a crafting bench and some wood planks.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>First I made some sticks, then I put some wood on top of it to make a sword, I needed a pickaxe, so I made one with the supplies I had. Volia! Done, a wooden pickaxe, and a wooden sword. I began mining away at the stone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I mined and mined. A loud sound was made from my pickaxe and pieces of it fell to the ground. I needed new tools. I took the destroyed stone and forged it into something new, a stone pickaxe.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I kept mining. I struck something new, something....</div></div>

This was Iron! I thought, I knew I recognized this, but how will I smelt it?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I began work on that, looking for coal, digging left and right, badda' bing, badda' boom. Coal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I rushed up the stairs, of my mine to my home, and begin constructing a furnace, plopping it down next to my crafting bench, slapped some coal in there and the iron ore <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>and...Volia<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm so god damn smart." I spoke aloud to myself</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I saw light peeking through the door. It was morning. I felt a very sudden jolt of energy and I dropped to the floor, blacking out, I swear I felt the word "Time out" was being said to me...</div></div>
