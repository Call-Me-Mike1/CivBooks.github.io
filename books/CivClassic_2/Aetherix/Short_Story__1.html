<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 38</a><div class="page-content">   An old story yet lives of the “Thorny Road of Honor,” of a marksman, who indeed attained to rank and office, but only after a lifelong and weary strife against difficulties. Who has not, in reading this story, thought of his own strife, and of his own</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 38</a><div class="page-content">numerous “difficulties?” The story is very closely akin to reality; but still it has its harmonious explanation here on earth, while reality often points beyond the confines of life to the regions of eternity. The history of the world is like a magic</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 38</a><div class="page-content">lantern that displays to us, in light pictures upon the dark ground of the present, how the benefactors of mankind, the martyrs of genius, wandered along the thorny road of honor. From all periods, and from every country, these shining pictures display</div></div>

Each only appears for a few moments, but each represents a whole life, sometimes a whole age, with its conflicts and victories.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We look down upon a crowded amphitheatre. Out of the “Clouds” of Aristophanes, satire and humor are pouring down in streams upon the audience; on the stage Socrates, the most remarkable man in Athens, he who had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 38</a><div class="page-content">been the shield and defence of the people against the thirty tyrants, is held up mentally and bodily to ridicule--Socrates, who saved Alcibiades and Xenophon in the turmoil of battle, and whose genius soared far above the gods of the ancients. He himself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 38</a><div class="page-content">is present; he has risen from the spectator’s bench, and has stepped forward, that the laughing Athenians may well appreciate the likeness between himself and the caricature on the stage.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to Homer—that is to say, they contended after his death! Let us look at him as he was in his lifetime.</div></div>
