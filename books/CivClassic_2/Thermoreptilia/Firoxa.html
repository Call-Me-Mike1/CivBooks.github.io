<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The stories and theories of Heliopyr tend to favor that idea that St. Firox was being hunted or prosecuted. Oddly, various theories have various timescales between the time Firox first arrived at the swamp to the time he perished.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the Necrult are an odd group. Their theories and stories often describe St. Firox as an hermit who struggled to settle the swamp.
