<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Fred and  Lisa ran in circles chasing fireflies, They caught them in glass jelly jars and displayed them proudly to anyone they could. They called them "bug lanterns." I thought they were a little crazy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Me and Kenny stood by the woods' edge thinking about how we could get into mischief but not get caught, Sometimes we would see bats flying thru the trees on nights like this while cicadas kept up a steady stream of insect chatter.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

The ground began to shake and a low rumble began from what seemed to be in the heart of the woods, and toward us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Toby, Lisa and Fred all panicked and ran hysterically to their back porch where the grown ups were barbequing and drinking beer. It was a big yard though and a long distance to run. They seemed to evaporate into the mist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Me and Kenny ran behind a big pine tree, poked our heads out from behind it and waited to see if we could see what approached, The ground shook, a signal giant eye got bigger and bigger as the noise grew louder and louder</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content"> I saw Kenny scream but could not hear a thing, I was screaming too but didn't know it until I saw my cousins and Kenny standing around me.</div></div>
