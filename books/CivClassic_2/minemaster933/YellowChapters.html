        Yellowed
        Chapters

  If you have reached this point you have yellowed yourself like the past pages on the book and accepted the Man in Yellow as your patron,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 7</a><div class="page-content">and a prophet has given you this co-signed book that has aged just like the drinks you intend to brew.
   With the acceptance of this religion if you will, you will be given a gift from our patron.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 7</a><div class="page-content">I woke up late last night in a cold sweat knowing what I must do. The shadows licked the walls leading to my work room which they themselves looked oddly decayed and yellow. I walk towards the door to the workshop of mine, the soul of our entire creed; my brewery station.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 7</a><div class="page-content">  The chests groaned and creaked telling me their secrets of what to pull out.  Several nuggets of glistening gold, about 20 I felt.
  The blinding glow from the dust in the corner of the chest called to me as well, though I only needed half as much of it than the gold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 7</a><div class="page-content">  I sat there for a dozen or so of time after putting it in that cauldron, whispers came out from the flames underneath it coming out to greet me.
  I don’t think I’ve ever seen something distill as long as this ambrosia, but if the Man in Yellow tells me, then it is so.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 7</a><div class="page-content">I am blessed by this new knowledge and this wonderful drink, and now so are you. Take these blessings and let it invigorate you to find more drinks like this and give yourself to the Yellowing and fade into the distilling of your soul for the Great Work.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 7</a><div class="page-content">we 
     Have a long road ahEad of us, 
     and It’S up to us to build the foundations
    NEeded to call AcRoss the 




Yellowing Forest.</div></div>
