While building the park I noticed a high and unusual amount of</div></div>

It would be only  a month later that I would decipher the runes on the side of the bridge which meant "Lake of Butthurt Tears".

The most fascinating find was what appeared to be ruins of a bathhouse, however the only entrance I could find was partially collapsed and I could not enter.

It also served a second purpose as a heat source so deep in the cold earth. Indeed, they exploited lava on a grand scale. It was trapped in ceilings and walls all across the district.

I recorded dozens of small, simple houses of the same design.</div></div>
