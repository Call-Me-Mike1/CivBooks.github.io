Readers are encouraged to acquire (legally) and read the first volume of this archeological project before reading this one.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 42</a><div class="page-content">After 2 months of delicate archeological work and goyim whipping my dispensable team and I have finally cleareda path to a new section of the city. This path stood different than the others and its features on the outside suggested it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 42</a><div class="page-content">was not part of the residential district, but in fact a different segment in this marvelous city.The path is in fact two seperate staircases reaching to a lower level area. Much attention and work was given to the ceiling of the staircases as well,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 42</a><div class="page-content">which is a fascinating example of the craftsmanship capabilities of this civilization. Between the two staircases ran a stream of water from the previously mentioned Nexus into a designated water dispersal infrastructure in the wall.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The other 2 paths nearby were more heavily blocked, some even covered with molten lava from broken pipes, thus making the work all the more dangerous and complicated. They seem to be paths into the same residential district and so with the complexity of opening them the task</div></div>

What overwhelmed me after however was not more stench but a great awe. It appears my instincts were co-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">rrect, as this was indeed a different part of the city. For a few weeks I carried very careful archeological work, cleanup and deduction over this site, this...structural complex. 

It was unmistakenly seperated from the residential areas</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">which means it had a great importance of its own to the former occupants of this city. The water entering this room through the previously mentioned dispersal infrastructure served more than just basic services, but had artistic value to it as well. From</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content">a small waterfall as the water falls down to the new floor level it seperates into an arch and disperses into the carved water tunnels that characterised this city since I first entered it, all the way to the end of the room and into further unseen passa-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 42</a><div class="page-content">ges in the walls.

In the middle stood, for the most part, a great table with dozens of chairs around it. At the front of the table was present a very large and impressive throne. At the top of it were carvings and runes. After deciphering what I could I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">believe it meant "great guardian" or "the most worthy".

From an unbiased archeological perspective this large chair, its position, and the runes inscribed in it suggest it was meant for a champion, or a leader. Perhaps a king? A warrior king</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">perhaps but no doubt someone who deserved a great amount of respect. Someone who'd be distinguished from his peers.
A notable new detail was the art work in the ceiling of the room. It was no plain flat ceiling, but well detailed and decorated with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Lapis Lazuli, relatively rare semi-precious stone that has been prized since antiquity for its intense blue color, and glowstone, a very rare alien material. Since light and heat is still in surplus due to the impressive infrastructure of lava tubes the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">presence of glowstone suggests its for decorative purposes as well, and to signify importance as this is not an easy material to obtain.

There were 4 additional rooms attached to this greater hall with no doors, meaning it was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">part of the same complex with no room for privacy. They were in fact 2 different types of rooms, but served basic individual needs. The first type is for group rest. A barracks of sort. It was crowded with beds even connected to the walls. A larger bed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">was present in the middle of the room. Such compressed rooms for rest are generally characterised as military ones. This would fit greatly into the role of this greater complex. This also means those larger beds were probably owned by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">higher rank officers. The other type of room appeared to be for brewery storage. Each of the two rooms has 2 very large storage units.

With all of this new data my established hypothesis was that this was a war room that also provided all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the basic needs of soldiers - and their king. No doubt reserved to the finest of soldiers to accompany their leader, where they slept and drank around the table but ever vigilant to carry out their duty. It was some sort of Valhalla, which in Norse</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">mythology is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin. In this mythical hall the greatest warriors feast and drink as they wait for Ragnarok - to battle in the end times. Could this city, its culture and history have its own</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Ragnarok? I also entertained the thought that this place is the origin of that mythology seeing as how ancient this place is.

For the most part, this room was remarkably well preserved, which is no small feat considering the detail</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">of work and decoration put into it.

At the end of the hall was an impressive large staircase leading dozens of meters down to a new depth level. The design for this staircase is highly impressive and appears to be exceptionally</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">resilient. Tubes of lava on both sides of it are present from beginning to end.

It's size suggested it was perhaps a popular and busy passage but being placed exactly behind the throne that seemed unlikely. It seems more possible</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">that this is where those many soldiers were expected to run down to during a time of crisis, led by the king who was the closest. It seemed to fit well. That would mean this is also the end of the domain of this city.

What I saw before me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 42</a><div class="page-content">however shocked me and made me believe my hypothesis was wrong at first. What I saw before me was not the end of the city in the regard I expected, and perhaps some gate and passage to the overworld, but a magnificent hall of mind boggling size.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 42</a><div class="page-content">How could these people have dug such an impressive room and built it so well? This room was preserved so well. Built so strongly and decorated in great detail. And it was nearly as big as the interior of the castle of Danzig. I could only imagine why it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">was built behind the room of Valhalla. But it still did not strike me as a popular passage or hall. If people weren't meant to pass through it. What was it meant for? Storage? Not for this grandeur.

The second thing that caught my eye was the splendid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 42</a><div class="page-content">architectural design of the support columns. It's difficult to detail them in a book, (and so I give you another reason to tour in this city and explore with your own eyes once we establish the proper visit fees and services), but they serve as both supp-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 42</a><div class="page-content">ort columns and lamps, as a part of them is made of strengthened glass with lava running in the middle.

The rest of the design wasn't very conventional either and quite unique.

Notably present in the great hall were beac-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 42</a><div class="page-content">ons of fire. I haven't seen fire yet in this city. Everything is lit and warmed by a system of lava trapping after all. This fire must have burned for a long time without intervention. Closer inspection revealed its fueled by netherrack meaning it can bu-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 42</a><div class="page-content">rn practically forever. Their presence is still a mystery. One of the Sabbath goys I employ jokingly that perhaps they were meant to scare wild animals. While my first instinct was to whip him for his insolence and attempt at free thought, it hit me that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 42</a><div class="page-content">perhaps there was some truth to it in essence, but I waited with that thought until closer examination of the hall. At the beginning of the hall, near the staircase, was present a beautiful fountain. The water came from a hole in the upper wall area and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">its source is no doubt from the water dispersal system related to that Nexus I left behind, or perhaps another I've yet to discover.

The water itself kept draining through another hole at the bottom of the fountain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Across the hall were some very large unique runes. They stretched across the entire length of the walls and across the entire hall. 

Each rune was unique and its size must have meant something. I had some familarity with this language</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 42</a><div class="page-content">and I would have quickly deciphered it if not for the damn sabbath goy crew mocking them as "moon runes". It seemed apparent they were becoming restless and had to be executed. A new supply would need to be secured from the overworld. For now however the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">task of translation remains incomplete.

The runes themselves were made of large amounts of Lapis Lazuli, while hanging between each set of columns hanged more of the rare glowstone. This further strengthened that not only hard labor was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 42</a><div class="page-content">invested into this room but also precious resources, signifying the high importance of this place. At the end of the hall stood a strong, very large sturdy door, made of the strongest material we know - obsidian, and decorated by some more Lapis Lazuli.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">It was sealed from the inside of the hall with the aid of a stone pillar. It suddenly all fell into place. This hall is indeed the end of the city. But I do not believe it's its entrance. With the symbolism of fire as I previously mentioned, the hall of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Valhalla guarding the only entrance to it, and what I could decipher so far from the runes that suggest of some "evil", this large door could be what protected this city from its special Ragnarok. Some sort of a terrible danger lurked behind that door, or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 42</a><div class="page-content">so the dwellers of this city thought. Some kind of "ancient evil" according to the ancient texts present in this hall. This place was a prison. Meant to cage a great evil. What stunned me was a reference to our great capital city. "The evil that will one</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 42</a><div class="page-content">day break free and claim Danzig as its own as well". How is this possible? How could they know? A shiver went down my spine. Suddenly this seemed less as a piece of mythology and superstition and more of a prophecy, of a great and ancient evil</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 42</a><div class="page-content">our supposed ancestors could not defeat, but could merely contain. An evil that is coming to claim us... to claim Danzig.</div></div>
