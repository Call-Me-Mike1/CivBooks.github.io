Berge Zion Goldberg, malevolent dictator of Gondolin, hungered for his daily meal of Catholic infants garnished with hemlock. He had the wicked pleasure of enjoying these meals ever since he seized power and started</div></div>

Berge was known throughout the land for his unruly treatment of citizens and sociopathy in regards to children. It was a death sentence for pre-pubescent boys recruited to his personal servant force. They were made to dress in</div></div>

As Berge called for his head servant boy, a child by the name of James. James limped</div></div>

Berge looked lustifully at the tear, thirsting for it, but dismissing the thought. 

After a short period of grilling, the infants were</div></div>

As he grabbed the first victim, he gazed out his huge window overlooking the oppressed people of Gondolin. He laughed at the horrible quality of life they endured, while he was enjoying a gilded life. He was just</div></div>
