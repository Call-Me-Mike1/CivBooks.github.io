This was supposed to be a full history of Prussia on the server, from inception of the 4th Reich to the foundation of Danzig. Unfortunately I'm losing internet access and won't be able to finish it as such.

It is not proper to describe Civcraft's Prussian nation without first mentioning the website from which it draws much cultural influence. In _dbb_'s own words: "/int/ is the biggest board on Krautchan, the</div></div>

Over time, Brazilians, Finns, Poles, Americans (or United Statesians, as Latin-American posters may insist on calling them) and many many others have invaded and influenced the board in the same manner, creating a</div></div>

A Swedish poster made a thread on /int/, bringing to light a minecraft server which promised politics, war, and wealth. Even more interesing: it was run by redditors.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Three traditions of /int/ fostered a great interest in this project, in an /int/-populated server on Civcraft.
 Firstly, /int/ loves geopolitics. By its nature as a board defined by international interactions, geopolitics is a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">common and much-
obsessed topic.
 Secondly, /int/ loves to play video-
games. A Bernd (the
German rough equivalent of "Anon" or "Anonymous") has lots of fun doing things with other Bernds all the while speaking in his strange internet</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">English dialect.
 Thirdly, /int/ already has a history of playing minecraft together.
 The Krautchan server, still alive though in one of its momentary depopulated phases, is a playground of fantastic architecture and interesting</div></div>

 I could go on to describe the history of all the politics on
that server, but the subject warrants more time than I have to describe it. The largest town to ever have been built there, Kurwa, is nothing short of a jewel of</div></div>

 I am sorry that I couldn't provide a true full picture of
/int/ minecrafters and what they mean for Civcraft, but I hope that my words have given the reader a good enough introduction.</div></div>
