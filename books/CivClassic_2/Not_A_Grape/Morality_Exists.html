 We will die. If we wish to preserve our genes into the future, we must provide a safe environment for children. If we wish to preserve our memes into the future, we must implant our ideas into other brains (this</div></div>

 The simplest way to play this game is force, violence. You can kill for resources to support your</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">children and ideas, but this method limits the safety in life (other animals and people retaliate when threatened) and, arguably, the quality of life (though you can be well-stimulated by complexity in fighting, it cannot match the diversity</div></div>

 Cooperation, however, works best for humans. If you can guarantee your neighbors' children's safety, and they can</div></div>

Agriculture, for example, is best done in groups and it guarantees</div></div>

 If you want to dip your feet into immortality, you must invest in patterns which outlast you.</div></div>

 Morality is this, it is an individual's effort to facilitate an environment for human genes and memes</div></div>

Morality demands that even if you don't gain from it, you must contribute. Well, fuck, gain from it as much as you can. Contribute as well, for your contribution sets an example for that system itself to last after you are gone.</div></div>
